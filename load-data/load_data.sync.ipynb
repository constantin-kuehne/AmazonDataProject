'Changeling' is the story of a single mother whose son is kidnapped by a ruthless child predator, and her fight to see his return despite the LAPD's attempts to deem her insane when she denies the young boy they push upon her is hers.<br /><br />The story is very interesting, and while the film starts out slow, it quickly gains momentum once she discovers her son is missing.  From the police investigation to her caring for the son that is not hers, to her being confined to an asylum for refusing to cooperate with the police department and the secrets revealed about the inmates' incarcerations, to the hunt for the man responsible and everything about him...it was just, at best I can describe it, a thrill ride.  I wasn't expecting it, but it put me in the mind of 'Silence of the Lambs' during some parts of the movie, in particular the search for the kidnapper.<br /><br />The movie is long I should warn.  Almost 3 hours if not, but once you invest your time into it, you won't notice as I didn't.  The ending was a bit surprising to me, but I was thankful that it wasn't predicatable or conventional, and just as thankful that I didn't do any research on the actual events.  I thought the cinematography was awesome, and this was by far some of the best acting I've seen from Angelina Jolie since 'A Mighty Heart.'  Clint Eastwood once again delivers and shows that there is nothing that he can't do.  If you're into period films, as well as mystery and suspense, then I totally recommend this film.\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-23 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'bU3z_H0BANdU85SxOb8F', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 20489235, 'review_id': 'R2C4GZIMOF3NMK', 'product_id': 'B000VI70WM', 'product_parent': 782790273, 'product_title': 'Red Carpet Massacre', 'product_category': 'Music', 'star_rating': 4, 'helpful_votes': 1, 'total_votes': 2, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'best since 85!', 'review_body': 'This album was a really pleasant surprise for me.

We are entering a progressive descent into some kind of hell but we go down one step at a time without knowing there will be more steps after this one. This descent is represented in the film by the steps going up to the house behind the motel, then the steps going up and down from one level of the cabins to the next, then the staircase inside the house going up to the rooms but also going down to the fruit cellar. This image, which is a metaphor of the mind when it is swallowed up by insanity, is essential and cannot be in color because an insane mind is a whole set of hues and shades of grey. But Hitchcock in this case constructs the plot itself that way. Sexual temptation for the boy friend, then mutual and reciprocal financial temptation for the money and the girl, then the run, the escape. And then one step at a time the trail is getting hotter and hotter. The boss seeing her driving out of town. The cop finding her asleep in her car on the shoulder of a road. The cop following her and observing her swapping her car for another. The motel to escape the rain and get some rest. The sandwich and the milk, the discussion and the mental trap for her, the poor thief, and for him the poor surviving son. And you can go on and on and that will lead you to the end, but with only one question in your mind. How is it possible that such doom can fall upon someone? But who is that someone? The son, Norman Bates, a killer of his own mother and her lover who was left free to survive in society? The poor thief Marion Crane who was trusted with the un-trustable, so much money that her jaws fell down? There is in this film, maybe more than in most Hitchcock's films, the sense of some kind of doom or fate or destiny governed and controlled by some kind of insane authority. Hitchcock was showing then the God he never alluded to in this film that was governing this world must have gone not AWOL as some may say but insane, frankly schizophrenic. For this sinister world to make sense, you need to state that the master mind of our cosmos is a double personality, good old god on one side and good old satan on the other side and the fight between the two are not even close to the beginning of an end and our lot will be like that tossed from the benevolent hand of god into the malevolent hand of satan and/or vice versa as many times as these two will find some pleasure in doing so, as long as we will not cut the branches and the roots of this divine and devilish schizophrenia that is finding its source in our very flesh and mind and that is outsourced by our spirit or brain into some autonomous though totally virtual, an absolute simulacrum, of reality, an outsourcing movement that gives us the illusion of sanity paid for by that mental and spiritual alienation that the invention of these two supernatural beings represents for us. Better be alienated in spirituality than divided in reality. That explains so well the fact that such lines of thinking and representing our own experiential life can lead to all kinds of possible bigotry and fundamentalism, as soon as we decide we are standing on the only side worth it, that is to say the side of good, the side of god, the side of light, without understanding that there are so many shades of light and so many hues of shade that if we all stand one-sided and one-spirited and one-minded for what each one of us consider as pure light we are absolutely doomed to commit our daily genocide every day between our morning shower and our breakfast, just as an appetizer for our day of labor. And Hitchcock builds that fate upside down for the poor Marion Crane: the genocide of Norman Bates' mother happens between Marion Crane's evening snack and her before-going-to-bed shower, a shower she will never finish taking and that will be turned into a long bath in some muddy pond. The final and concluding image of the car containing the body and the money being pulled out of the pond is the wink Hitchcock addresses to us for us to go back in time and enjoy the film as a rotten metonymy of real life. He even imposes onto us a five minutes psychological ranting discourse from the local psychiatrist to convince us that all is normal since everything is upside down, but is it? Is it not the reverse: everything is upside down since all is normal, or is it everything is normal because all is upside down, or whatever? Add a touch of color to that film and you will produce a big meaningless mess. Black, white and grey become death so well, just like mourning becomes Elektra.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesontaining the body and the money being pulled out of the pond is the wink Hitchcock addresses to us for us to go back in time and enjoy the film as a rotten metonymy of real life.

I\\'m happy as a clam!  Not only is the remastered sound quality top notch (just as the first three reissues were), the packaging should win an award.  When fans are hoping a \\\\\\\\\"deluxe\\\\\\\\\" reissue of a classic meets their expectations, this one is a prime example of how to appease, (I was SO hoping the label would go so far as to recreate the original red velvet jacket and BY GOLLY THEY DID!).  Not only that but I get a sticker and a poster in the package as well, are you kidding me?!      First off, this reissue sounds amazing!  Details previously lurking in the background of the original vinyl release now come to life like never before!  And this remastered version has provided a major breakthrough for me as a fan of this album, my ears have FINALLY opened to the three orchestral instrumental pieces featured.  I bought my first used vinyl copy of this album in 1997 and almost always skipped over the instrumentals.  To these ears, not one of them \\\\\\\\\"delivered\\\\\\\\\" to me at all, but that\\'s not the case anymore!  All three are strikingly beautiful. There\\'s no need to go into how great The Bee Gees\\' songs are on this album, it\\'s the early Bee Gees for pete\\'s sake.  Their vocal and songwriting greatness was already a given by the time of this album.     The mono versions of these albums have been such a treat on all of these reissues.  Unlike the mono version of an album such as The Beatles\\' \\\\\\\\\"Sgt. Pepper,\\\\\\\\\" there are no real differences between the mono and the stereo mix like a different guitar track or vocal here and there.  The difference lies within the perception of the ear that\\'s hearing it.  I\\'ve always found the mono versions to sound much more cohesive and more like a live performance of the material.  The mono version of \\\\\\\\\"Odessa\\\\\\\\\" seems to actually bring the entire album together better than the stereo version does.  It\\'s probably because mono mixes remain steady throughout while stereo mixes can rock you back and forth with each track.  I actually prefer to listen to the mono versions on headphones to get the full impact of the mix.  Highly recommended!    The \\\\\\\\\"Sketches For Odessa\\\\\\\\\" disc is great, with some of the demos actually rivaling the finished songs on the album.  Now how a song titled \\\\\\\\\"Barbara Came To Stay\\\\\\\\\" turns into a song about Thomas Edison I have no idea, but somehow it did.  Both the demo and early take of \\\\\\\\\"Melody Fair\\\\\\\\\" are equally strong in their melodic appeal.  The Part Two section of \\\\\\\\\"Whisper Whisper,\\\\\\\\\" cast in a waltz time, doesn\\'t work and it\\'s a good thing they decided to pump it up with some soul for the released version.  After all, it\\'s one of the best sections of the entire record.  The demo of \\\\\\\\\"Lamplight\\\\\\\\\" is especially intimate and charming, proving the song\\'s ability to tug at heartstrings without so much heavy echo and orchestration.  The early take that follows showcases the song on it\\'s way to becoming the finished product but isn\\'t nearly as charming as the demo.  The song is great being on one extreme side of the map or the other, but not in the middle.  The early take of \\\\\\\\\"Give Your Best\\\\\\\\\" sounds great just being a straightforward country tune without being dressed up in the novelty touches that the released version has.  The \\\\\\\\\"Seven Seas Symphony\\\\\\\\\" demo is very eloquent with Maurice\\'s piano playing.  The alternate version of \\\\\\\\\"Never Say Never Again\\\\\\\\\" ALMOST works, that is until the overbearing, distorted lead guitar overdub comes in and sinks the entire track like the ship Veronica itself!  The alternate \\\\\\\\\"First Of May\\\\\\\\\" features an even more heartbreaking lead vocal from Barry than the released version.  Closing out the disc are two previously unreleased tracks that could have been issued as an non-LP single, and why that wasn\\'t considered is weird to say the least!  Both \\\\\\\\\"Nobody\\'s Someone\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"Pity\\\\\\\\\" are so good it\\'d be hard to pick one for an A-side!  My bets would be on \\\\\\\\\"Pity\\\\\\\\\" simply because it\\'s more upbeat and catchy.    Onto the packaging, I love how the inner sleeves look for the CDs!  The stereo/mono versions are housed in a gatefold cardboard jacket that looks like it could have succeeded as the album\\'s original cover.  The \\\\\\\\\"Sketches For Odessa\\\\\\\\\" is in it\\'s own separate sleeve looking like it could have been it\\'s own album all together.  Heck, even the front picture on the inner booklet looks like it would\\'ve made a great cover!  BUT, a problem that plagued the original vinyl release plagues this CD reissue as well.  It seems that you just cannot have a flocked cover without little hairs getting all over the discs!  Fortunately with a CD, you don\\'t have to worry about the fine hairs being grounded into any grooves when you play it (the hairs on my vinyl records are etched into them for life).     If the mono version of this album hadn\\'t been included I would\\'ve rated it at four stars for being \\\\\\\\\"VERY GOOD.\\\\\\\\\"  The packaging alone warrants five but it\\'s the music contained within that always comes first.  \\\\\\\\\"Odessa\\\\\\\\\" is a great double album, a must for any Bee Gees fan, but still remains a tad bit overblown.  The album has always suffered, in my opinion, from lack of a better track sequencing.  Closing the album\\'s third side with TWO orchestral instrumentals is just absurd no matter how you look at it.  However, it works itself out much better presented in CD format (you can now pretend that \\\\\\\\\"With All Nations\\\\\\\\\" opens side four).

I had already taken in the Universal,Hammer and various other essentials made from the 20s to the 70s.    Like many a Horror fan,I went through my gore and brutal phase,and John Carpenter was one of my idols.  Having seen The Thing(1982),Halloween(1978) and Escape From New York(1981),I had highly anticipated The Fog(1980).  It was a wonderful Horror film,playing like a classic Ghost Story,that unfortunately many in my seemingly,close-minded generation passed on.    Ten years later,I went back to re-discover many of the films of my teen years,and discovered Carpenter\\'s The Fog in my DVD collection.    Far from a nostalgic remembrance,this film is a welcome relief from alot of the mindless and charcaterless gore films of that period and now.  Played as a Ghost Story in the style of Val Lewton,it also combined elements of Carpenter\\'s Halloween and the typical Hawksian touches such as snappy dialouge and strong characters.    The gore is minimal,as the film wisely relies on atmosphere and build(the credit sequence in the beginning is among the scariest in the film and keeps the audience defensive ALL the way through!).  Carpenter gathers a good cast in this one including Tom Atkins,Jamie Lee Curtis,Janet Leigh,Adrienne Barbeau and Hal Holbrook,who all add an era of believability to there roles.    It\\'s also a plus that the otherwordly denizens of the Fog are the work of Rob Bottin,who later creates the shape changing monstrosities on Carpenter\\'s The Thing.    The story is simple:A ship of gold carrying lepers are killed years ago,there gold stolen.  100 years later they return to the coastal town where they wrecked and begin to murder for revenge...and the return of there gold!    It\\'s handled surprisingly well.    The DVD is nice filled with two documentaries,a script to scene comparsion,awesome trailers(\\\\\\\\\"What in the HELL is in that fog?!\\\\\\\\\") and audio commentary withCarpenter and producer,Debra Hill.    I had picked this up for the cheap price of three bucks,but have to say it\\'s worth the price Amazon charges for it.    Very reccomended for the Horror fan who is more interested in atmosphere and suspense than just buckets of blood.    A good one.....don\\'t miss it!

The hypnotic, mechanized vocal samples on the erie, lo-fi tune haunted me while I impatiently waited for my ordered copy to arrive from Amazon.com.  I even found myself listening to the thirty second clip of \\\\\\\\\"Archangel\\\\\\\\\" from the online order page, over and over on repeat, until the day the record showed up.  What\\'s so captivating about Burial you ask?  Well, it\\'s  hard to pin down, but allow me to embellish the sound of Untrue for a sec.  The signature jittery high hat shimmers and rim shot patterns, create a consistent, mellow breakbeat rhythm that gently but hastily pulls the synthetic strings and  pitch altered vocals toward what feels like is going to be a build up, but turns out to be just more anticipation.  Meanwhile, a dark cloud of exaggerated vinyl hiss, and a swarm of random, crispy blips loom over the mix, while an unimaginable amount of reverb sucks the whole thing into an ambient abyss.  There are really no obvious climaxes at all, rather a constant payoff in the gradual acknowledgment that the anticipation is fraudulent.  Over filtered, melodic vocal samples come and go like specters searching for a living soul to connect with. Hopelessly mumbling love songs, they rarely succeed in doing more than emphasize the somber, emotional void before being smeared into the hazy obscurity.  As the cover art indicates, this record is meant to be listened to on headphones, preferably with the jacket hood up, during an engaged people watching session.  You won\\'t likely find this album on shelves around the city, so pick it up on online or at the very least purchase the \\\\\\\\\"Archangel\\\\\\\\\" mp3 from Amazon.com for ninety nine cents.

There appears to be a discrepancy in his version of events.  He claims that he dropped out of school before graduating.  Then for several years he was a laborer.  Let\\'s assume this is at least three years or else he wouldn\\'t have used the word \\\\\\\\\"several.\\\\\\\\\"  Then, he says he got a job on a tramp freighter and saw the world for eight years.  That makes eleven total years.  Afterwards, when he couldn\\'t find laboring jobs any longer, he went into sales.  Add another year to make twelve years.<br /><br />According to his timeline, within one year of starting in sales he was a top salesman and a year after was made a Vice President in charge of 95 people.  Adding two more years brings us to a (minimum) grand total of fourteen years.<br /><br />None of this seems unusual until Mr. Tracy triumphantly adds that at this point he was only 25 years old!<br /><br />Does he really expect us to believe that he dropped out of school at the tender age of 11?  Could this be an example of Mr. Tracy trying to make his early life sound a little tougher than it actually was?  In the same way that a rap star claims to have grown up in the projects to give him more \\\\\\\\\"street cred\\\\\\\\\" when he really grew up in a middle class suburb?<br /><br />While Mr. Tracy\\'s life story is strange, it doesn\\'t take anything away from the advice in his book, which I found to be quite useful.

This is normal if you\\'re used to a previous version of the game where there was no frame to keep all the hexes together (there was no sea frame, just sea hexes). So yes, it takes a bit of effort to push everything down but it will lay flat with just a bit of effort.    For new players: Please DO play your first game using the recommended map layout and starting positions in the rules. It can be tempting to jump right into a random map game where the map and setup is different every time you play - the trouble is, until you are familiar with the game, you won\\'t pick the best starting positions. And a bad starting position will put you behind for the rest of the game and you won\\'t have enough fun to motivate you to want to play the game again.

The story reads like an actual screenplay and it definitely feels like it comes off the pages.<br /><br />Our characters instantly make themselves favorites in the comic book world.  Alan Moore couldn\\'t have imagined better ideas.  He kind of makes fun of the superhero idea and slams our brains with the reality of it.  This realistic approach to superheroes totally gives comic readers a new perspective and that makes this novel extremely valuable.<br /><br />I won\\'t get too much into the politics because I wasn\\'t alive at the time.  I believe, however, that it gives the book a much bigger importance by tangling itself into the real world.

It is sci-fi fantasy with realistic proportions; it is suspenseful; it is about ethics and loyalty; it is about integrity; it has a romance that has boundaries; it presents the possibility of a healthy parental relationship; it promotes an environmental message without extremism. Most importantly, it helps young people redefine the qualities of beauty.<br /><br />The book begins in a futuristic society where Tally awaits her 16th birthday - a milestone when she will be ready to have the operation to make her a Pretty.  As a Pretty, she will enter the world of the Pretties - full of fun and happiness.  She meets another Ugly who tells her about a world outside the Utopian system and who tries to entice her to escape.  She wonders why anyone would want to avoid a world of happiness and the opportunity to be beautiful?  Their friendship results in a terrible choice for Tally. Which will bring more sorrowful consequences - to betray her friend or remain loyal and lose her personal hopes and dreams?  This young girl's choice unravels a dark secret and changes society as she knows it.<br /><br />Uglies is very well-written with characters that are gradually and skillfully developed.  The plot unveils at a consistent pace so that there is never a dull moment.<br /><br />One caveat - like Lays Potato Chips, you cannot have just one.  While sufficiently resolving the first novel, the author has built-in a device where you will be compelled to read the sequel.

Read it and read it again!', 'review_body': \"I haven't read a Jane Austen novel in years. The last time I read one of her novels I was very young and it was not by choice. If you want to rediscover Jane Austen, start with Emma. This novel is about a very snobby, spoiled, and at times malicious young lady by the name of Emma Woodhouse. Emma lives in the village of Highbury with her hypchondriac father. After Emma's Governess, who throughout the book is known as Mrs Weston marries, Emma is left with a lot of time on her hands. I'm afraid she does not use this time wisely.    Emma finds a new friend and protege in Harriet Smith, a young lady with an unknown past who Emma takes under her wing. Emma brings it upon herself to give young Harriet somewhat of a social makeover. She induces her to aspire to greatness and put on airs proper to a lady of Emma's class, although she's not even sure what class Harriet belongs to. When Harriet is offered marriage by a farmer by the name of Mr Martin, Emma is horrified! She convinces Harrriet that such a man is hardly worthy of her and intices her to find romance with the handsome but vain vicor, Mr Elton. Emma's disasterous matchmaking decison is the focus of the book.     I found this novel incredibly amusing!  Emma's unbashed snobbery, Harriet's ignorance, Mr Woodhouse's constant worry of illness befalling every character in the book. This book is literally laugh out loud funny at times. The novel features many other equally amusing characters. Mr Knightley, Emma's sister's brother-in-law, who is the one person in the novel to always tell Emma how it really is. The chatty and annoying Mrs Bates, the insufferable Augusta Elton who is almost as full of herself as Emma.     When Jane Austen wrote this book she claimed no one but herself would like Emma Woodhouse. Emma is conceited and selfish, but the beauty of this book is that Emma is forced to come to terms with what her behavior has caused her and those she loves. The Emma you meet at the beginning of the novel is not thesame Emma that you say goodbye to at the end.     If you want a simple description of what this novel is about I will tell you that it is about a young lady's road to maturity and growth. Jane Austen isn't for everyone, but if you are curious or want to give her novels another try, start with Emma. It's guaranteed to renew your interest in one of the greatest writers in English literature.

You can argue and say that `The Departed' made such an impact, beings that it did walk away with top honors, but seriously, no one was talking about `The Departed' like they were talking about `Little Miss Sunshine'.  It became a phenomenon.  The following year `Juno' waltzed up to an Oscar nomination thanks to the success this little yellow bus and even this years `Slumdog Millionaire' is being called the `Little Film that Could'.  `Little Miss Sunshine' represents that little independent film that garners cult status quickly and finds a place in the hearts of award bodies everywhere.<br /><br />Now I liked this movie, but personally it isn't deserving of the unabashed praise it received.  It's actually quite common and not very imaginative when you think about it.  It's sweet and charming but nothing new, and while it has it's moments of wit it also has awkward moments that you know are supposed to be funny, but just aren't.<br /><br />It's a mixed bag for me.<br /><br />The film follows the Hoover family (as dysfunctional as they come) as they embark on a cross country trip to get young Olive to a beauty pageant.  Richard, the father, is a self obsessed man who aspires to get famous off his step program to a better you.  His wife Sheryl is merely trying to hold together her family while remaining remotely sane.  Their oldest son Dwayne has taken a vow of silence while he waits to join the Air Force.  Richard's father Edwin is a foul mouthed gruff drug addict with a heart of gold and Sheryl's brother Frank is a suicidal teacher who is crumbling emotionally after a sour relationship with a male student.  Stuck in the middle is young impressionable Olive who just wants to be pretty.<br /><br />Everything that can go wrong does go wrong, but tagged onto the end of this comedy is a message of togetherness and family; a spark of sweet saccharine goodness that makes you feel a little better about yourself and your loved ones.  I understand why people like this film; even I liked it, but I find it hard to consider it the best of anything.<br /><br />Breslin is a natural talent; very genuine and believable.  One friend of mine said that he never caught her acting, which is very true.  I have always liked Kinnear and I found his turn here probably best in show.  He was superbly entertaining and understandable as the controlling father obsessed with winning.  Toni Collette continues shining her beacon of light on everything she touches; and I adore her for that.  There was a lot said about the supporting actor race that year and the three `Sunshine' men; Alan Arkin, Steve Carell and Paul Dano.  Honestly I fell that AMPA's got this one right, and I know that not many agree with me there.  I thought that Arkin was very genuine and heartwarming here, even at his crudest.  No, he should not have won, but that's beside the point.  Carell was also very warm here and understood his character (what a stretch for him) and Dano was interesting yet a little vapid.  I found his emotional breakdown rather hard to believe, but he does try really hard so I'll give him props for that.  He stepped up his game in a HUGE way the following year with a stellar performance in `There Will Be Blood'.<br /><br />Truth be told, the funniest parts in this movie involve running, and just the sight of any of the cast barreling down a street or a parking lot gives me the giggles.

I've listened to it a couple of times, and I think it's going to take a while to grow on me. There are some excellent, immediately accessible tracks, and the band is extended to include other musicians, notably Doyle Bramhall II, with whom DT played with Eric Clapton on tour last year, and who co-produces some of the tracks here. My first impression is that this album has a narrower musical spectrum than the superb Songlines, which is on almost permanent play in my car. However, each of the previous DTB albums have been rather different from one another, so I suppose fans should have expected this! This album is the first produced by DT himself, and recorded at his new studio at his home in Florida. I think that DT's innate humility has resulted in less prominence for his own playing and more emphasis on a group performance. It has a more bluesy feel than Songlines, with the world/roots influences definitely muted by comparison. However, my immediate feeling is that if I'd never heard Songlines, Already Free would be brilliant and worth 5 stars. So, I guess it's going to take a while to soak in, but I'm sure it will become a favourite in time - I find that albums with immediate payback pale after a while, but those you have to work at a bit are ultimately more rewarding.

Brilliant album all the way through.  The album starts off with the breaking glass rhythm flowing very nicely into 'The Runaway', which I'd only heard so far on the live GG album 'Playing the Fool'.  The studio version is fantastic.  'An Inmates Lullaby' is good, more subdued, where Derek Schulman sings in a strange falsetto. 'Way of Life' returns to an upbeat rocking tempo altho there will be tempo changes throughout the song, with some great keyboard work from Kerry Minear and great guitar from Gary Green. Very progressive sounding, I really loved this track.  'Experience' is another great track that, before this cd, I had only heard live. Kerry Minear handles the lead vocals with Derek handling the 'Master inner voices, making the choices' part.  It's *classic* Gentle Giant.  Next comes another Minear track 'A Reunion', a delightful medieval piece featuring some nice violin from Ray Schulman.  Minear's vocals in the studio are fantastic, but as I understand it, too weak for live performance where Derek usually takes that task.  However, Minear is the natural choice for all GG medieval style music.  The studio tracks conclude with the title piece 'In A Glass House'. Once again we hear some really nice violin to start and then Minear's progressive keyboard work.  There's even some saxophone in here from Derek.  This track could be considered a showcase of GG's multi-instrument viruousity.  The track fades out and ends with an audio collage of bits of the album.  Very nice.    With the Alucard release, you'll get two live bonus tracks; 'The Runaway/Experience' and 'In a Glass House'.  Both are worth the price of this album alone, but coupled with the brilliant studio tracks, make this an essential GG album.  5 stars.\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-23 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': '3k3z_H0BANdU85SxOb8F', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 25799069, 'review_id': 'R1U3H354R9WDWB', 'product_id': '0439023483', 'product_parent': 245449872, 'product_title': 'The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, Book 1)', 'product_category': 'Books', 'star_rating': 5, 'helpful_votes': 0, 'total_votes': 0, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'What I really hated about this book...', 'review_body': 'is that this book came out in fall of 2008 and I read it in January of 2009.

There are no princes waiting in the wings to save her. She is her own champion. Katniss lives in a world so desperate that love is stretched to the limit. What will you do for your sister? Will you starve for her, commit illegal crimes punishable by death for her, and even die for her? What will you do when a stranger saves your life with a simple gesture? Owe them forever? Save them in return at the cost of your own life?    With the livelihoods of her sister and mother resting on her shoulders Katniss\\'s situation seems to harsh for her to keep any bearing on humanity. What is the point of morality when you are watching your loved ones starve? Yet, even in the middle of the brutal Hunger Games in which her life and death struggle is merely an amusement for the wealthy she has a respect for human life surpassed by no one else. Unlike those with lots of food and comfort she does not have the luxury of caring about anyone but herself and yet she helps, saves, and grieves over the lives of everyone she meets. She\\'s not sickly sweet, innocent, or annoying. But she does everything she can to be honorable and kind just as she does everything she can to survive a senseless bloodbath in which she\\'s expected to kill anyone who crosses her path.    And I can\\'t wait to see how the Big Brother \\\\\\\\\"Panem\\\\\\\\\" is to be dealt with in the next two books. Katniss is not one to back down from a fight and it it\\'s obvious from the beginning that the eventual confrontation with \\\\\\\\\"Panem\\\\\\\\\" will be the biggest fight of her life.    Also I\\'d like to see just how the Peeta-Katniss-Gale love triangle turns out. Peeta (a kind, gentle, and even sweetly vulnerable baker\\'s son) and Gale (a resourceful, cautious, capable, strong coal miner\\'s son) seem to represent different sides of Katniss. Perhaps Katniss\\'s choice between the two is more relevant to the world of Suzanne Collin\\'s little post-apocalyptic book than what at first seems apparent.    I don\\'t think this book is to bloody for most kids. I think that one of the important points to take away from this book is that life is harsh, tough, desperate but that doesn\\'t mean we should give up or hide. Actually, I think a book like this might even be empowering for most kids. As a kid, I would have loved Katniss and would have wanted to be strong like her. Heck, I do now as a twenty something.

The Name of the Wind is a powerful read and Rothfuss is that rare gem of an author who has not only genuinely mastered the art of story-craft, he has utterly redefined the bar of excellence of an entire genre all within his first published novel.<br /><br />'Wind' chronicles the early adventures of our young protagonist, Kvothe.  In a few words or less, our hero encounters life's ups and downs as he pursues his goal to attend the University to become an archanist; a surprisingly simple and in hindsight, almost clique plotline for a 662 page hardcover book.  But herein lies the unparalleled talent of the author-- his brilliant storytelling.  Most remarkable is the haunting and beautiful description of music.  Rothfuss claims not to be a musician and I can hardly believe it.  I am a molded musician, and how a non-musician can capture that intimate and indescribable love with mere ink and paper is beyond me.  Wind's beautifully crafted prose and pacing sweeps like Beethoven or Rachmaninoff; we laugh out loud and sigh, sometimes cry inside, all the while reminding ourselves to breathe as the pages turn.<br /><br />Rothfuss has done a fine piece of work and there are but a few holes to poke at.  First is the above mentioned plot.  The plot was the &quot;weakest&quot; link in the entirety of `Wind' but herein lies the difficulty of confining arcing plot and broad character motives into a cut section of a story.  The Name of the Wind is the first portion of a continuous story never meant to be broken into a trilogy.  Most of this first book is character building and we get to know Kvothe in a way like you would a new friend over an autumn Sunday brunch.  To his credit, Rothfuss does a fine job of sectioning the story off in book one.  Near the end, we get a feeling of winding down, content with some victories and still hungry with some wants.<br /><br />Secondly, the numerous try-fail cycles regarding Kvothe and his love interest Denna became redundant, especially since each hopeful meeting ends pretty much the same way each time.  Denna is mysterious for no good reason and Kvothe's infatuation with her is not well motivated, though perhaps understandably so when it comes to the nature of attraction.  Near the end of the book, I'm rooting for Kvothe to rid himself of his obsession already and get along in finding his first real love who names him 'Dulator'.  Also superfluous is the large section regarding the draccus encounter near the end of the book.  Much time is dedicated to this rabbit trail of a side story which results in little more information gained of the antagonistic Chandrian, no souvenir of the rare draccus to take back to the University as show and tell, and another chance and convenient bump-in with the stunning Denna which ends in yet another dead end where the girl disappears and the boy must temper his raging hormones in disappointment.<br /><br />All in all, a most inspirational debut.  'Wind' is not just a one night stand.  With subsequent reads, slow down and appreciate the unique elegance of description, the lyricism and rhythm of the writing.  Each sentence is loved and carefully crafted, not a word is wasted or wanted, and our deepest emotions are touched with simplicity of words both said and unsaid.  Bravo for an arresting prologue bristling with questions and the reminiscently similar yet conclusive epilogue.  Hints and juicy bits of future plot are revealed in good proportion within Wind, not so much to leave too many unanswered questions, but making us near wild as we wait and clamor for the second book.  Readers be warned that Rothfuss is just warming up.  The back of the book blurb of Wise Man's Fear was recently released and it promises a sweeping scope of a story.  Combined with the expected quality of writing, readers are in for a treat.<br /><br />Name of the Wind is my highest recommended book of the year.  Considering this is only the debut novel, one can only imagine what will be rolling off the press in years to come as Rothfuss heads the pack of young, revolutionary authors that are pushing and redefining the limits of the Fantasy genre.  5 big shiny stars.f the year.

Rocky is still as palpable as it ever was because it\\'s one of those rare films that speaks directly to the heart--everyone pulls for the underdog. Almost all successful men and women were chosen from birth to be successful. These people are born to the right people and have the right pedigree. These people are born tall, or strong, or beautiful. These people may be born rich, or these people may be born into a stable middle class home. Even if they are born to a single parent, these individuals are born to a single parent who wants the best for them, a parent who\\'ll sacrifice everything to send them to the right schools, a parent who\\'ll scrub floors to send that kid to college. Some people are born and raised by both their parents and their grandparents. Look at Obama. Could he have overcome his racial heritage and his economic disadvantages without the love, guidance, determination, and support of his mother?--I don\\'t think so.<br /><br />Then, there are those of us who aren\\'t so lucky. We\\'re born dirt poor. No one loves us. We aren\\'t tall, strong, smart, or beautiful. We\\'re doomed in the womb. We watch as others leave the neighborhood for colleges. We watch our neighborhoods change around us. A building\\'s torn down; a new building goes up. We carry our dreams in our pockets with the few pennies we are able to earn with our High School diplomas; worse still, we\\'re dropouts and can\\'t find anything at all. We fade like afterthoughts. We become neighborhood faces,like that old busted chair or knicked-up table that never moves no matter what. You could paint the room, change the pictures, change the carpet, or change the sofa, but that old busted chair or knicked up table remains a constant fixture. You say to yourself, \\\\\\\\\"if only someone, somewhere, gave me a break,\\\\\\\\\" but all you get is scorn, rejection, and ridicule. There\\'s no excuse for any grown man or woman to fail, they say. Go to work, they say. Why aren\\'t you like such and such, they say. You should be doing this, they say. You should be doing that, they say. You look in the mirror and you see the deepening lines in your face; you look sad--you look away from your reflection. You crawl inside of yourself. You drink,you smoke--you don\\'t care anymore. You\\'re no good to a woman; you\\'re no good to yourself. You\\'re not a man anymore. You resign yourself to your fate: you\\'re a loser. You\\'ll live, you\\'ll die, and that\\'ll be that. So, you go and throw your last pennies and your dreams into a fountain and you make a wish. Then, out of the blue, opportunity takes you by surprise. At first it seems too good to be true. You\\'re afraid that, at any moment, you\\'ll wake up from a cruel shimmering dream. Then, you realize that you are not dreaming, that chance is smiling in your direction.You cry. You thought she\\'d forgotten you, but she didn\\'t. Chance comes early for some and late for others and when she leaves she\\'s gone forever. So you take your chance, and you make the most of it--you turn your life around and the people cheer you on. You\\'re born again.<br /><br />To me, this is the essence of Rocky, and no actor could have pulled it off like Sylvester Stallone. If you\\'ve ever been down or counted out, his realistic and raw portrayal of a down-and-out loan-shark collector will resonate with you. Bill Conti composed the soundtrack to this film. When Rocky\\'s sprinting across the wharf to \\\\\\\\\"Gonna fly Now\\\\\\\\\" you want to stand up and cheer him on. My favorite point in the movie is when Rocky goes down in the fourteenth round. Everbody--his trainer(BurgessMeredith)and his cornermen--are screaming and telling him to stay down and take the count-out. But Rocky\\'s been down forever and this time he\\'s fighting for the only chance he\\'s ever had in his whole miserable life. Then, Adrian (Talia Shire) is standing in the back of the arena watching Rock; she\\'s crying. She closes her eyes and says a prayer. Bill Conti\\'s \\\\\\\\\"Going the Distance\\\\\\\\\" is soaring as Rocky makes it to his feet. He\\'s bloody and swollen--he can barely see out of his right eye--but he shakes his head and tells the ref that he\\'s ok. Then, with the champ bearing down on him, Rocky sees his opportunity. The champ\\'s hands are high, his bruised right ribs are exposed. Rocky surges up with everything he has and smashes a left uppercut into the champ\\'s ribs. The bell rings, and Rocky survives the round. I don\\'t know if the film would have been as effective without Bill Conti\\'s soundtrack; the soundtrack gave a voice to every scene in the film. Scorceses\\'s Taxi Driver came out the same year as Rocky and many critics and fans feel that Taxi Driver should have won the Oscar instead of Rocky. If you go on the technical merits of both films, Taxi Driver is a superior film to Rocky; however, Taxi Driver does not stir the collective imagination as powerfully as Rocky does. Rocky is both universal and primal: almost everyone\\'s been down at some point in their lives, and almost everyone has a heart--in these respects, Rocky is superior to Taxi Driver. I\\'ve seen thousands of great films, from Hitchcock to Bergman, Kurosawa to fellini, Lang to Lean, Kazan to Copolla; Rocky remains my all-time favorite film.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001PKUVW6 Bondage and Discipline, Sadism and Masochism: Zack\\'s Odyssey Part 1]]men--are screaming and telling him to stay down and take the count-out.

David Cook worked hard on all of this beautiful work and richly deserves every bit of praise he is getting - and will get - as more and more people become aware of each and every one of these brilliant collaborations. I knew Permanent was an ode to AC, but I didn't anticipate weeping immediately upon hearing the brief preview of this song. Anyone who has had a loved one ill with cancer can relate to the beautiful words and music. Every song on this album is outstanding. And just as David broke records previously on the billboard charts - I suspect this outstanding album will likewise soar to the top up the charts. Outstanding work.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL COMMENTS<br /><br />The more I listen to this CD - the more incredible it is. Call me crazy - but I could wait for the physical CD to be delivered so I ordered from iTunes - and commented accordingly based on the above brief previous review. Needless to say the music is outstanding - I have incredible taste - and that includes my love for David Cook's music. There was no doubt in my mind this album was going to rise to the top and deliver. And - of course - it goes far beyond our expectations - even for those of use who knew it would be great!<br /><br />PERMANENT<br /><br /> I can't STOP listening to this song. It is one of the best songs I have listened to in my lifetime. It has a haunting melody - and beautiful - yet gut-wrenching lyrics that make me want to listen to it over and over and over again. It is just as relative to someone going through a divorce - or any illness or difficult experience. I find it mesmerizing. It would be easy to hear any number of professional artists covering this song - from Bette Midler to Bruce Springsteen. Also - I really expect to hear it one day in a movie -- unless it is too personal for David to lend permission.<br /><br />DAVID COOK<br /><br />David Cook is a true artist and rock professional. There is no doubt - with his magnificently blessed voice and enormously charismatic persona that he will be a talent to be reckoned with more years and years and years to come. His voice is mind-blowing. His music is outstanding. His personal presence and charisma is incredibly vulnerable and sweet yet he exudes sexy beyond my comprehension.

I suppose that was how Hollywood sold its stars back then. The last critique about the movie I have was that the ending was totally watered down and was not the much anticipated ending I thought would be offered since I felt it very symbolic to the whole moral of the story anyway. Other than that, I think the movie is worth it.<br /><br />...and you shouldn\\'t worry about hidden socialist or communist messages in the movie. I had read a professional review about the movie from another web source and the reviewer had mentioned that the movie made more of a political statement than the book. What? The only resemblance to any socialistic or communistic ideas I encountered were in the book and that (socialist) was how the authorities treated/policed the migrants and (communist) how Tom tells someone \\\\\\\\\"Damn right, I\\'m Bolshevisky!\\\\\\\\\" referring to Bolshevik and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and how the migrants were left with no other choice but to form their own communities if you will. So, for me, I just ignored those pretenses and enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />I hope you will too.lls someone \\\\\\\\\"Damn right, I\\'m Bolshevisky!\\\\\\\\\" referring to Bolshevik and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and how the migrants were left with no other choice but to form their own communities if you will.

There are more memorable lines of dialogue in this film that speak of the truths of life than in some entire years\\' worth of Oscar fare.  \\\\\\\\\"You do a thing and that\\'s what you are\\\\\\\\\".  Simple. Concise. Easy to understand. Irrefutably true. We are each nothing more than the sum of the things we have said and done.  This is the meaning of life and it\\'s in one throwaway line from a film filled with nearly two hours of genius.  The setting of New York is so quintessentially American that this film would not have worked anywhere else.  There is just something so instantly recognizable and identifiable about that city that every man, woman, and child in America feels like they\\'ve lived there even if (like me) they have never even been there.  There simply is no other possible place for Travis Bickle to dwell and it is used to full effect in this film.  Also of note is i9n the movie Cybill Shepherd\\'s hotness.  Her character\\'s overreaction to porn speaks of serious issues, but I suppose when you\\'re that gorgeous you can afford to be prudish.<br /><br />What most people remember from \\\\\\\\\"Taxi Driver\\\\\\\\\" is the legendary bit where DeNiro stands in front of a mirror and practices taunting an imaginary foe with the iconic line and mannerism that will never die, \\\\\\\\\"You talkin\\' to me?\\\\\\\\\".  Influences of the film that I didn\\'t mention in the video include numerous other musical references and homages in film and television.  In an episode of the second season of the cult television series [[ASIN:B0019BI11O Code Monkeys]] (only first season on DVD so far) there was an episode called \\\\\\\\\"My Pal Jodie\\\\\\\\\" which mocked the controversy surrounding violent video game slike [[ASIN:B000FRU1UM Grand Theft Auto]] by featuring a video game where you play as a man trying to kill a world leader known as \\\\\\\\\"Ray-Gun\\\\\\\\\" to win Jodie Foster\\'s love.  So 35 years later, \\\\\\\\\"Taxi Driver\\\\\\\\\" continues to inspire commentary on current events.  If that is not a deep work of art, nothing is.<br /><br />This is a movie that will speak to anybody who\\'s found society to be nearly irredeemable, but is still compelled to seek a connection to the people within it.  Go get yourself \\\\\\\\\"organizized\\\\\\\\\", understand all that is you, and take it to the world at large in the way you see fit.  This character\\'s plan of action is contrary to my very nature and downright psychotic, but as a fictional person in a work of art, his rampage is inspiring in it\\'s purity.  Bickle\\'s missions of choice are very different, but the same in that he seemed to seek to free the two women in his life from the thrall of two very different but in their own way powerful men. Travis may not have accomplished all of his goals in the movie or even consciously known what they were, but in his violent unfocused catharsis he does save the soul of young prostitute even as he abandons his own.  And even doing so in brutal fashion, he at least gains the respect of a woman he loves but will never understand.  Leave it to the media to turn a bloodbath into an act of heroism.<br /><br />The special features on this DVD include two commentaries, some great featurettes with Scorsese talking about his personal experiences, point of view, and goals when he made the film, and plenty more to delve into.

His language may at times seem a bit archaic, but I don't think we suffer from hearing people talk properly. The actors he works with adore him and the freedom he offers them.

Pullman is an artful storyteller, and this series is more than sufficient evidence. The plot is epic, enthralling, and will keep you glued to your seat for hours. And its themes are though provoking and challenging.    That said, I cannot recommend this series for everyone. Some will find its take on the secular-religious struggle unsettling or outrageous (read any one-star review from your neighborhood conservative Christian). And I do find the subtle thematic progression to be a distasteful choice: the fantastic plot in the first book lures young readers not yet able to analyze the the series' themes in terms of symbols, metaphor, or abstaction as they become more overt later on in the series.    While it has been called the antithesis to C.S. Lewis' Narnia series (which, by the way, also ought not be read by children until they reach an age where they're ready to interpret the symbolism and hold a few abstract discussions on religion), Pullman comes off not so much as atheist as humanist, condemning organized religion not spiritually, but on a utilitarian scale that weighs heavily against its potential for corruption, social ill, and ability to inflict guilt disproportionate to the fault, and lightly on its potential to work moral good.    If you can handle a mature discussion of the aforementioned topics, I highly recommend this series, and might even suggest a comparative reading of Pullman against Lewis.  Worth a read for the narrative alone if you don't find the themes distasteful, and definitely a strong pick to read for discussion.\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-23 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'KE3z_H0BANdU85SxOcAF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 48036726, 'review_id': 'RLOSH978PRL1C', 'product_id': 'B001F0VHEM', 'product_parent': 254998502, 'product_title': 'Funhouse Pink', 'product_category': 'Music', 'star_rating': 4, 'helpful_votes': 2, 'total_votes': 3, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': True, 'review_headline': 'Marital angst and some fun too boot !', 'review_body': 'Ok, first of all this entire cd is dedicated to her working out her pain, sorrow, anger and fear of her ending marriage.

It seemed that every few pages I was being told to buy this book, or buy all of some other guys books. There is a two page section that is taken from Guy Kawasaki\\'s blog. The whole thing is incredibly derivative (but shallow).    Finally, and this I can take responsibility for, it didn\\'t meet my needs because I am not Al Gore, nor am I the CEO of a company. If I gave a presentation in the style of this book I\\'d be laughed out of the office. I\\'m an analyst, and the warm and fuzzy slides would not be good. Duarte\\'s advice on data intensive slides? \\\\\\\\\"Both [of Stephen Few\\'s] books should be on your shelf along with everything Edward Tufte has written.\\\\\\\\\"  I have two Tufte books and they are virtually identical, I don\\'t see myself buying his others (and they suffer from the same lack of relevance to corporate analysts).

However, the book taught me a lesson that the thickness of the book has nothing to do with the ease and the speed of reading, and that \\\\\\\\\"popularity\\\\\\\\\" has nothing to do with \\\\\\\\\"good content\\\\\\\\\"....  The book was so boring and was so tedious in all those \\\\\\\\\"outliner\\\\\\\\\" stories that it made me fall asleep constantly. I knew it was going to be a lousy book after I read the introduction, cause it was so boring and tedious and the introduction sounded pretty irrelevant to \\\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\\\" which is the topic of the book....The author was forcing a link of relevancy by saying at the end of the introduction.... \\\\\\\\\"The value of the world you inhabit and the people you surround yourself with make you the person you are....\\\\\\\\\" something like that.... So all of a sudden, I got this after I read all the boring mumbles about the health issue in a small town up in Pennsylvania, and then the book began its first chapter about \\\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\\\", only it didn\\'t get any better, cause I found myself reading another boring mumbling chapter about some Canadian Hocky Team and its  scoring history and the long tedious tables of birthdays and names and hit/miss (whatever the game calls it) records of the teammates....Again, what was the point of this book? Teaching me how to appreciate Hocky?  Chapter after chapter, there are more boring long stories that the author forcibly made them connect to  the book\\'s topic on \\\\\\\\\"how people become successful\\\\\\\\\". I totally felt like a loser just by buying this book and even felt  more like a loser by reading it. I should have tossed it away and not cared so much about the money I paid for it.  \\\\\\\\\"Money can\\'t buy time\\\\\\\\\".  My dad told me over and over when I was a kid, and obviously, I hadn\\'t learnt.  So forget about the book, some of the things we need to become successful are, \\\\\\\\\"not to follow the crowd\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\"value our time\\\\\\\\\" , \\\\\\\\\"be able to cut our losses before more loss or damage is incurred\\\\\\\\\" , \\\\\\\\\"always learn our lessons and remember them\\\\\\\\\".  Guess this book did teach me something afterall....<br /><br />Feel like this book is a ripped off... It can be summarized into the following:  Combinations of factors that contribute to success are complicated and diversed... can be luck, can be your family, can be your school, can be just your birth place or your birthdays... etc etc.... (so does that mean the author himself doesn\\'t quite know what the exact formula to becoming successful is? So he wrote a book just to explain why he doesn\\'t know and nobody can possibly know the exact factors that make people successful??? Cause they can be uncontrollable, or predetermined... or whatever...), but according to the author, you can still make it thru hardwork and perseverance.... Doesn\\'t this sound familiar?  So all the tedious mumble jumble outliner stories that torture me many evenings all boiled down to this.  Now if you want to be successful, don\\'t be like me, stay away from this book, go watch a movie, try out a new restaurant, arrange a date with your spouse or someone you like.... go to a concert... but never stay home and read this book like I did.lessons and remember them\\\\\\\\\".

Some knock it totally saying it is in no way a horror movie.  Others see it for what it is.  It has never been called a horror film .  It has a presence of horror in a different way and is a true story that is more a courtroom drama that explores how the legal system deals with the case of a girl who died after an exorcism and while under the direct care of a priest.  Was she epileptic and psychotic?  Or was she possessed.  Medical facts verses spiritual facts.<br /><br />THE EXORCIST was a story that had the exorcism and gore galore in the forefront with the story of its characters in the background.  THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is about an exorcism with the strong story in the forefront.  This is a 5 star film.  We have three of the best actors of this decade - Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson and Scott Campbell.  These are hardcore actors and each tackles their role with strong intensity.<br /><br />Now before I continue I want to comment on how the film appears in blu ray.  It is absolutely astounding.  The 1080p high def picture is crystal clear and the truehd audio will blow you away.  This must be viewed with a 5.1 theater system.  I have seen this film many times and the clarity in blu ray makes the courtroom scenes seem as if I am watching a play and the actors are in my room.  The film does manage to expertly show the progression of Emily Rose's deterioration and if you view it with blu ray and a theater system the sound will have you on the edge of your seat and jumping out of your skin.  (Important note, if you watch DEXTER, it is great fun to see Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose.  She is superb.)<br /><br />Blu ray allows the viewer to see the emotions of the actos much more clearly.  Laura Linney is the attorney defending the priest accused of Emily's death and she is at first a self professed agnostic.  But the film is largely about how the whole affair affects her.  At the end she is very troubled and doesn't know what she is.  But her life is totally changed.  Even with all the great acting the film in my opinion belongs to Laura Linney and Jennifer Carpenter.<br /><br />If you want a standard B horror film with blood and gore this film is not for you.  This film is an insightful, intelligent courtroom drama about a very unique case and it is scary, suspenseful, troubling and dramatic but for different reasons.

I had heard info from Dr. Ornish and McDougall in programs and articles, and I knew Oprah had been sued for saying she was cutting out beef, but that was about it. Even if correct, I thought The China Study might seem like someone selectively choosing data to suit an agenda. In fact, I think Campbell ended up finding the opposite of what he started out expecting.<br /><br />Reading the book and checking the 35 pages of small print of reputable sources, I was amazed at how much research over so many years has shown that changing diet can slow and even reverse disease. That even if you are exposed to carcinogens or have a genetic predisposition, you can still affect your outcome with diet. It makes sense to me - seeing that Americans have such a high incidence of diseases that we almost consider inevitable, and yet some other parts of the world have much lower statistics for the same problems. And also knowing that migrants end up taking on the risks of the diets found in the countries to which they move.<br /><br />It's a good thing that diet can help reverse disease, because I'm guessing most people won't think seriously about their eating habits  until they get some bad news. When my father was diagnosed with cancer, suddenly we became avid readers of information about every kind of treatment and about diet. And diet is one of the easiest things for us to take control of at a time when things feel completely out of control. I hope this book helps more people slow the progress, and even prevent the onset, of diseases like cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. I also hope school lunches will someday at least include more whole plant foods like brown rice and leafy vegetables to help the next generation.<br /><br />If there was one thing I'd change it would be the title of the book.

It has contributed to the nonsense that there was a conspiracy - it is convincing when it presents the 'facts' but this film is full of errors. Also, as an artistic film, the strength of the story / emotional drama etc... is carried by the gravity of the evidence / material but one you realize this is all a fake and a Hollywood bastardization of the truth it falls apart factually and artistically.    This film has more holes than a wicker canoe. True, some of the evidence was 'gospel' when the film was made but many errors and half truths made it into the film as absolute fact. Some examples:  -Oswald was a lousy shot: in truth he was an expert shot and a sharpshooter - they even have his shooting tests from the military  -3 shots in 6 seconds - it wasn't. It was 8.3 seconds, and it's easy (time-wise)  -the head back and to the left - the wound evidence that Cyril Wecht has made a career out of criticizing is conclusive that he was shot from the rear. Conservation of momentum shows that if a huge heavy chunk of head moves away at high speed that the body will move in the opposite direction - in fact ANY direction is possible depending on the entry and where the fragments blow out  -the magic spinning bullet - anyone with 2 eyes who has really looked at the Zapruder film can see that when that shot was fired that Connelly was sitting lower than JFK, towards the middle of the car, and sharply turned - not sitting square and facing forward as shown in the film - when you connect the lines it make a perfect straight line  -the pristine bullet - it was not pristine, the groove pattern matched the rifle, PROVING it was fired by the rifle found in the book depository and there are missing fragments that were found in Connolly.  -I don't remember if it was in the film, but the microphone evidence has all been disproved    Also, Garrison's testimony in the real case relied ona  witness who admitted he never saw Clay Shaw, Ferry and Oswald together - when asked under a polygraph yes or no, he said 'well if you ask me yes or no, it would have to be a no'    Garrison suborned perjury in this case - that seems clearer and clearer over time. We don't want to accept that this dysfunctional insignificant human being who even the soviets got bored of (and realized he was useless as a piece of propaganda and sent him back) could possibly have cut down such a great historical figure. We don't WANT to believe that, but it is true. Garrison makes him out to be a hero double agent! For God's sake, this guy was a personality disorder whose only double agent work was trying to act tough and be a commie wanna-be who would annoy anti-Castro Cubans then later appear on TV to advocate Marxism. He was an attention hound ! The 60s weren;t today - not everybody got on TV looking for 15 minutes of fame like today - you had to try hard... He would constantly mix himself up with these people to stir the pot like all dysfunctional personality disorders who live off the reaction they create in others. That's why everyone think he's tied up in some conspiracy - because of the company he kept, his changing positions etc...but in reality he was playing people for reactions. It's pathetic, really.    So save your money and watch any of the excellent documentaries that tear this apart entirely. And don't (like me) waste any money on 'The Men WHo Killed Kennedy' documentary from the UK either - more pseudo-science with a deep british narrator's voice which is also full of errors and omissions and even wilder theories than in 'JFK'    People like pathologist Wecht have done a huge disservice further stirring this pot. Sure the gov't has screwed up aspects of the investigation and autopsy etc.. Show me anything they get right!    It's time to stop this nonsense once and for all - don't waste your money on the upteenth reissue of this dog of a film and make Stone ever richer than healready is. Look for a book or documentary that tells you the real story.     So, yawn, this is all phony Hollywood melodrama.

After all, it does not follow that simply because one employs a particularly beloved signifier in a title, that the object signified by said title accrues some metaphysical value, which is not credited to texts bereft of such clever strategies. Indeed, one must be quite bold to actually invoke \\\\\\\\\"Kafka\\\\\\\\\" before many who will examine and possibly read it has any other experience of one\\'s work. As it turns out, Murakami is absolutely justified in his appropriation of Kafka\\'s name in title of this wondrous work of imaginative brilliance.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the very real and significant contributions Freud made to our understanding to the workings of the mind, I maintain that his true claim to fame is as the greatest mythologist of the 20th century, especially in his later writings, and most especially in his books dealing with the socio-political foundations of society--The Future of an Illusion & Totem and Taboo come to mind--and commentary on such relations, which are found throughout his work. In order to walk away from these amazing books having gained anything of value, one has to be willing to give Freud a certain amount of artistic license and suspend disbelief. Having done so, the payoff is immense. For example, I found  that The Future of an Illusion is a perfect way to off-set Aristotle, J. S. Mill, and old Manny Kant, in that it offers a such a radically different account of the foundations of and motivation to morality that students must rethink all of the theories from beginning to end. (I don\\'t use Nietzsche\\'s On the Genealogy of Morals for reasons of temporal economy.)<br /><br />A similar act of faith is the very condition of the possibility of reading much more than 15 pages of this work of shockingly expansive imagination. As something of a fetishist for magical realism, I am more than prepared to have characters give birth to cats, dance with the devil, and defy the never questioned convention that holds that nature is ruled by certain unbreakable laws, such as gravity, when, in fact, the strongest claim that we can make as to the continuation gravity\\'s felicitous effects is that they have not failed to obtain to this point in human history, as far as we know. I must say, however, that neither de Bernieres (I am thinking not of Corelli\\'s Mandolin, but of his early trilogy, which elaborates the history of the fantastic village of Cochadebajo, which is in the same metaphysical neighborhood as the village to which Kafka Tamura, the title character as you will have guessed, travels in seeking to achieve what Nietzsche calls the most difficult task: becoming what one is.)nor Borges, Bulgakov (The Master and Margarita) nor Allende, not even Garcia Marquez,the Master himself, prepared me in the least for what lay ahead in Kafka on the Shore.<br /><br />Frankly, Murakami is in a league all his own. He requires not simply that we suspend disbelief, but that, in addition, we suspend all belief as well. In order to fully enjoy such an adventure as he has created in Kafka on the Shore, it is necessary that we do everything we can to approach the text with a tabula rosa. The less we know--or, shall I say ironic as this combination of words may appear, the less we believe ourselves to know, the more receptive we will be to the actuality of the work of art that is in front of us.<br /><br />There are plenty of talented, even brilliant writers. There are even quite a few whose talents reach far beyond a technical competence for putting a story together in a coherent and compelling fashion, but I have never encountered a writer with the temerity of Murakami. Kafka on the Shore would be just as easily at home in a class introducing metaphysics, specifically regarding time and identity, as in a survey of postmodern or contemporary fiction. Indeed, I would have hesitated not to give it a double classification Literature/Philosophy were I a publisher more interested in veracity than in the philosophy of money.<br /><br />One could easily write a book on Murakami\\'s theory of time, the profound elaborations of which I have not seen the likes of since Faulkner\\'s Oh, Jerusalem I Forget Thee, or Wild Palms. Likewise, there is an entire physics of identity, which lay at the heart of the book. One, moreover, which is rather Freudian, to say the least. For as it turns out, Kafka seeks nothing more than to avoid his father\\'s curse that he will be murdered by Kafka, who will then sleep with this mother and his sister: Aeschylus by the Shore just does not have the right ring to it.<br /><br />Starting off from this premise--of which the reader remains ignorant well into the text--Kafka, who is 15, runs away from home and by virtue of a force no more under the power of his will than pure contingency, he ends up in Takamatsu. As serendipity would have it, this is the very same town to which Mr. Nakata, who has murdered Kafka\\'s father--ignoring the fact that he somehow deposits bloody evidence some distance away from the scene of the crime, where Kafka happens to have blacked out--also eventually travels. Mr. Nakata is  one of the more interesting characters in literary history. He is not very smart, not being able to read or write, but he has the singular ability to converse with cats. That is, until he encounters Johnny Walker; whether Mr. Walker is red, black, or blue we have no indication. Suffice it to say that Colonel Sanders is dealing in something more than 12 original herbs and spices these days; though the women for whom he serves as pimp are spicier than anything one may find on one\\'s fried hen, if the example we are introduced to is any indication. Yet, he remains a friend to the community and not simply a trafficker in sex, for without him neither Kafka, Mr. Nakata, nor any number of secondary characters would be able to fulfill their destinies.<br /><br />So, are you following me? No? Good, then you have some idea, however penurious and nebulous, of what it  is like to take a trip to the shore in the mind of Haruki Marakami. Hell, Kafka reads like Kant when placed beside this fantastic phantasmagoric writer the internal logic of whose book is unimpeachable. And this is perhaps the most stunning feat of all the various and sundry Enquirer like activiities that occur in the novel; this most impossible narrative turns out to have been obeying the laws of (dia)logical formations from the very beginning. Though it takes far longer to comprehend this than it does in your average everyday ontologically unstable narrative, the events of the story have unfolded according to a certain necessity, which was laid out from the very first pages: absolutely stunning!<br /><br />In short, I recommend this intellectual adventure to everyone who thinks it exciting to think differently than one did the day before, and is willing to continue to have one\\'s thinking evolve to the point of devolution. Fortunately, and perhaps this is the true gift that Murakami possesses, the author takes us time and time to the edge of reason and sense, only to pull us back just when we have been convinced that it may be  best, if we were to go ahead and plunge body and mind into the abyss. Indeed, for those whose intellectual promiscuity is somewhat more reckless than the average homo sapien, it would be difficult not to feel let down at having been teased with the possibility of a beautifully transgressive literary experience, were it not for the fact that the next available opportunity for trying on a novel identity is found on the very next page or sooner. I do, however, have one rather serious warning; Kafka on the Shore is not for herd animals or for anyone who believes that syllogistic logic is the be all and end all of human intellectual achievemenet, which really amount to the same thing, when one thinks about it. Long live narrative and ontological uncertainty! Long live Haruki Murakami!ver penurious and nebulous, of what it  is like to take a trip to the shore in the mind of Haruki Marakami.

And it is as breathtaking as the play.<br /><br />The premise circles around doubts the three main character had among each other and the doubt on what is faith, love and care. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is an old school nun who believes in old values and old ways of life. New inventions, including ball point pens are making people losing their disciplines in life by finding an easy way out. In come Sister James (Amy Adams) who displays a committing passion for teaching the new generation. She is young and has strong compassion for her students. On the other side is the unconventional priests loved by the congregation who uses ball point pens (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and believes that the church must move on with the congregation to retain their faith in the church.<br /><br />No doubt these characters clashed with each other - all out of good intend - but then became a tug-of-war that brought the peaceful parish into intellectual intrigues. Who knew the Bible better could no longer be proved to be a sure winner and everyone needed to pull out all the tricks they have under their sleeves.<br /><br />Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman proved that their Oscars in the past are well deserved. The subtleties, the mind games and their confrontations are so gripping that you just couldn\\'t take your eyes off the screen. It has been quite some time that a confrontation done only through dialogues and out-witting without any physical actions have been so breath taking and rings in your head even after you left the theatre. This is great theatre brought on to the silver screen. And these two Oscar winners just did the transition perfectly. Amy Adams tried very hard but she is up again two legends, so she is on very disadvantageous grounds. But she managed to pull out a fair game to show that she is more than a happy chanting princess in \\\\\\\\\"Enchanted\\\\\\\\\". Another memorable scene is the confrontation between the student\\'s mother (played by Viola Davis) and Sister Aloysius. The dynamics of trusting and doubting and the revelation of new information that tips the balance of power to and fro was just spectacular.

Almost throughout, the orchestra is \\'acoustically edited\\' via microphone placement and (re)mixing to emphasize what Karajan views as the important parts of the sound, while diminishing all the other \\\\\\\\\"stuff\\\\\\\\\". A simple case in point (as there are 38 CDs!), is the last movement of the Chaikovsky Third Symphony where the strings are almost not present -- at all. The first time listener would miss 40% (or so) of this movement; it\\'s simply all brass (and quite close mic\\'ed as well).    Bruckner Seven and Nine as two more examples reflect the same \\\\\\\\\"my vision\\\\\\\\\" attitude. Forty years (or so) later, I have become accustomed to basic excellent performance; the playing on many of the \\\\\\\\\"lesser\\\\\\\\\" works (eg lower number Bruckner, and Chaikovsky) is often \\'radio orchestra\\' quality.    The Beethoven cycle, excellent in many ways is for me caught up in the personality of Karajan. I think of how Furtwangler brings out the epic and drama without always saying \\\\\\\\\"look at me\\\\\\\\\".

That album is Pink Moon. That damn thing haunts me and I think about it at random times and feel an urge to listen to it immediately. A Love Supreme is the only other album that does that to me.<br /><br />Five Leaves Left however would come next. For me it doesn't live up to the hype and I don't particularly love it. There isn't a single bad or weak track here, they are all great in fact. Drakes lyrics are easily the most personal and best written here as against the other two albums. His guitar playing is a virtuosic as always, but something about this album just doesn't feel right. Maybe because Pink Moon was my introduction into Drake's music it will always be the standard for me to which I compare the rest of his work. It may sound quite jaded but it isn't anything I can help.<br /><br />Only three songs on Five Leaves Left really hit me as classics and as brilliant. 'River Man' being the first. The somber tone in Drakes voice accompanied by the slightly out of place string arrangement is the sort of thing John Lennon and Paul McCartney tried to do with 'A Day In The Life' but didn't quite pull of. The second being 'Three Hours.' This to me might be the greatest song Drake ever wrote next to 'Pink Moon.' In at a staggering six minutes in length, which is like the equivalent of 'Mountain Jam' for the Allman Bros. it is truly a mini-epic. Lyrically it is unparalleled by anything else. The mood is dark as usually but I can't help but feel hope in the songs melody. The chugging bass line accompanied by almost renaissance guitar give an uplifting feel. The song is pure genius. The third being the lyrical genius of 'Fruit Tree' in which on his debut album Drake confesses that he knows his music won't reach the acclaim and recognition it should until his life has ended. Poetic bliss.<br /><br />As for the rest of Five Leaves Left nothing stands out, nothing strikes me as blaam! Though nothing else is bad. It just simply plays, and plays well. For a debut album, Five Leaves Left is incredible, but it still showed that Drake had more ground left to cover.s life has ended. Poetic bliss.

Coming along in a time of music when damn near every album was difficult this manages to be even more so. Adding to the fact is that no other album by Drake is this busy. But more so than that, I don't know if I actually like this record. I have listened to it over and over again but I don't think I even like it in the slightest bit. Much in the same way that I think Sleep Dirt by Frank Zappa is a fantastic record but cannot stand to listen to the damn thing. Bryter Layter suffers equally. I think this is a nice, or at best decent record despite the fact that I often find it impossible to listen to it.<br /><br />For me many of the songs here are forgettable and stand out very little in my mind if at all. 'Hazy Jane II' stands out the most in my mind but mostly because I hate the song. I truthfully find the whole whoa-is-me folky-jazz number incredibly pretentious and trite. Though I can respect and fully understand why so many consider it a full blown classic and the star of Bethlehem on this record. 'Introduction' stands out to me because it is the part of the album I love the most. Drake's fantastic finger picking of acoustic guitar has been one of the things I love about him most. His knowledge of alternate tunings and wide range and reach make for one underrated player. 'At The Chime Of A City Clock' is the only other standout for me. The subtle drumming mixed with the bright strings remind me of Central Park in the winter. The song is beautiful.<br /><br />As for the rest of the album I couldn't even begin to describe another song with out hearing it because they all seem so blaa to me. What doesn't help this album for me is that the fantastic guitar playing of Thompson is really out of place on a Drake record, and Drake's own guitar playing is ofter lost in the production which also on this album is some of the worst I have ever heard.<br /><br />But what really bothers me about this record is that it is without a doubt Drake's most depressing album lyrically, and musically it is as bright is a sunny may afternoon. I always thought if I heard an album like this it would be genius, much like Lou Reed's Berlin, but I must say Bryter Layter totally put all this to rest. It is just down right annoying and for those people out there who don't listen to the lyrics, (they know all the worlds but not what they mean which blows me away) this would seem like a happy album, which it totally is not.<br /><br />So no I can't truly give this a better rating than a three because it simply isn't that good. With all hype and tragedy aside, Drake was a genius but genius doesn't always work out for the better as attested to here.really bothers me about this record is that it is without a doubt Drake's most depressing album lyrically, and musically it is as bright is a sunny may afternoon.

Unlike some of the earlier books, this one is filled with comments about the weaknesses and the deterioration (according to Mankell) of traditional Swedish society and mores.  He laments the breakdown of the nuclear family while making the point that post-WWII society has done much to raise the standard of living for the average Swede.

However, in my opinion, that doesn\\'t make this album less brilliant than her previous two.  It\\'s a solid release and I think it just takes a couple of thorough listening sessions to let it sink in.<br /><br />For one, the lyrics on this album are by far her most expressive ever.  If you take the time to actually listen to them, they tell a story that you can picture in your head.  That\\'s brilliant song writing. Sure, a lot of it is sad, and it might not be your cup of tea, but she wrote it from the heart without the intention of making perfect \\\\\\\\\"pop\\\\\\\\\" songs.<br /><br />Also, the musicianship and production is the best I\\'ve heard from Dido.  I\\'m surprised at the 1 star reviews due to this aspect alone.  Some of the drumming is amazing, and the use of different types of instruments is a nice change from other typical pop albums.  The arrangements are also very unusual, but fresh.  However, that may be another reason the songs don\\'t sound so \\\\\\\\\"radio friendly\\\\\\\\\" as some prefer.  It is not too busy sounding and cluttered as you sometimes hear in over-produced albums.  You can clearly here ALL parts being played as well as the intricate sounds in the background that Dido sometimes likes to throw in.<br /><br />My only (slight) disappointed might be Dido\\'s use of her own voice.  Her voice is definitely in top form and pleasant as usual.  However, she doesn\\'t sing with the authority she\\'s capable of.  Anyone who has seen her perform live knows she\\'s capable of singing more strongly to give more impact to the songs.  However, since most of the songs on this album are mellow, her soft airy voice works well to convey the emotion.<br /><br />Anyway, please give this album a couple of tries before dismissing it. If you can\\'t get past Dido\\'s typical style and be open to her new sound, then in my opinion, you don\\'t really accept the strength or growth of her as a songwriter.

This is a dark movie about a sad lonely boy who is coming of age, dealing with bullies and suddenly meets a young girl who he befriends.

The father story left me wondering wether alcoholism led to his situation but then again there could even be a creepier element there.

His part was too small for me to notice him in BODY HEAT. The critics had caught a glimpse of him and his potential in that film. I knew that I was on to something watching him as the fast talking womanizing Baltimore con-artist Boogie, in Levinson\\'s DINER. His honesty as an actor pierced my emotions, even though he was playing a character that was lying throughout the entire film. When I witnessed his serene and suicidally introspective portrayal of The Motorcycle Boy in Coppola\\'s urban dreamscape of S.E. Hinton\\'s teenage angst novel RUMBLE FISH, I knew that I had just witnessed The Rebirth of James Dean. When I saw his cool slowburning streetwise Italian dreamer, Charlie in THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLIAGE, I knew I had found a film actor I could idolize. I wore my hair like him. I tried to dress like him. I wanted to be him. Man, this was the COOLEST actor taking the coolest parts in Hollywood! Mickey was IT!<br /><br />But, like Dean, it seemed that Mickey would metaphorically and almost literally crash and leave us with only three truly GREAT films. After a few briefly compelling performances in the 80s as the hardboiled Kowalski in Cimino\\'s YEAR OF THE DRAGON, the lascivious John in 9 1/2 WEEKS, Harry Angel in ANGEL HEART, and the hilarious Henry Chinaski in BARFLY, Mickey\\'s career dwindled into lesser leads, bit parts, and cameo roles. Mickey became \\\\\\\\\"difficult\\\\\\\\\" to work with. Mickey wanted to give up the studio politics and the collaborative involvement with a craft that he was, quite literally, born to do. And become what? A boxer? The owner of a hair salon? A biker? A thug? Then, Mickey lost himself for 14 years. In a reply to a ten year hiatus question backstage at The Golden Globes, Rourke said, \\\\\\\\\"Let\\'s get it right. Ten years sounds easy.\\\\\\\\\" Ultimately, he was alone. Mickey Rourke was forced to do some soul searching.<br /><br />Into the 21st Century, no one noticed Mickey\\'s hilarious turn as The Cook in SPUN. A wild and sardonically dark comedy about methamphetamine users. (The Cook watches and adores wrestling on TV while cooking up his dope. One wonders if this gave Aronofsky the idea to cast Rourke in THE WRESTLER?) His sad and tender moment at the end of that film was a revelation of things to come. The final monologue is a wonderful precursor to his character in THE WRESTLER. It broke my heart. Then, a new generation of fans and critics were talking about him again, after grabbing everyone\\'s attention as disfigured Marv in Robert Rodriguez\\' comic book pastiche, SIN CITY. Sort of a throwback to Rourke\\'s JOHNNY HANDSOME. The best thing about SIN CITY was Rourke\\'s performance. It stood out like a sore thumb. Even over the special look of that film.<br /><br />Now, things have changed for Mr. Rourke. With the critical acclaim (for once they got it right) for this film, he is all over the talk show circuit recalling his loneliness, his mistakes, and episodes from his former life. Like a 12 stepper, Mickey now seems humble and apologetic. Thanking everyone for giving him the chance to once again become the serious actor he once was. (We should all thank them too.) He is no longer taking anything for granted. Everyone loves a humble winner. And God Bless him, Mickey Rourke is BACK! And his performance in THE WRESTLER is a WINNER!<br /><br />The generous Mr. Darren Aronofsky has given Mickey Rourke the role of a lifetime with this film. Knowing Rourke\\'s reputation for being next to impossible to work with, Aronofsky could not get the financing for this film when he first attached Mickey\\'s name to the project, but promised Mickey an Oscar nomination if he would only listen to his direction and do everything he was told to do. Mickey kept his promise, and it appears that the masterly and prescient Aronofsky has kept his. THE WRESTLER was not written for Mickey Rourke, but was later tailored to fit him personally. The themes are semi-autobiographical.<br /><br />The story is not complicated. Although, changed and improvised due to Rourke\\'s involvement, the script, written by Robert Siegel, is reminiscent of a 20\\'s or 30\\'s bloody pulp fiction boxing story that could have been penned by the creator of Conan The Barbarian, the late Robert E. Howard. It is a simple pulp character study about a lonely beaten man who has been to the top of the mountain only to be brought back down again by the repercussions of his actions, and a savage career choice that has taken a brutal toll on his body from staged battles, steroid juice abuse, and a lot of 80\\'s Hair Metal. (The biggest laugh in the film, comes from Rourke\\'s line about Kurt Cobain and what he did to 80\\'s Metal.) Filmed in a grainy Indy style with long loose tracking shots and circular handheld camera movements, it is a sad, gritty, brutal, and COMIC semi-documentary narrative told mostly from Randy \\\\\\\\\"The Ram\\\\\\\\\" Robinson\\'s POV. Not every movie goer will appreciate the raw look of this film, the patchwork sequences, or the triumphantly open ending. True film lovers will.<br /><br />The performances here are very brave indeed. Marisa Tomei is essential as Cassidy. She bares it all as a sweet, conflicted, past her prime stripper mom, unwilling to succumb to The Ram and his half desperate attention for her affections. Most 40 something actresses wished they looked this good, but might never agree to pole dance almost completely nude in a film about an aging wrestler. You will fall in love with her all over again in this film. Her Nomination for a Golden Boy is well deserved.<br /><br />Unlike De Niro who donned 40 lbs of fat for his role as Jake LaMotta, Rourke bulked up approximately 40 lbs of muscle on top of his already commanding girth. Rourke is scarred, pimpled, pumped, and battered. His body and visage are roadmaps of world weariness and pain. One grim shot shows Rourke shooting steroids into his veiny, mottled, and scarred rearend. A selfless dedication and adherence to character. A fearless commitment by a great actor to shamelessly open himself up to his audience. Baring his wounded nakedness, as well as the internal wounds to his lonely psyche. And isn\\'t this what we love about our greatest actors? This film IS Mickey Rourke. Body and Soul. This is an extremely giving performance. It is symbolic, commanding, sad, demanding, honest, demure, comic, tender, uplifting, and most of all, heartbreaking.<br /><br />A broken man searches for acceptance, dignity, and redemption, but finds himself instead.<br /><br />The same can be said about The Second Coming of Mickey Rourke. THIS IS A GREAT FILM! Just give this man his Oscar.

I actually started reading the book that this series was based on by Evan Wright before I started the series. The characters that were described so well in the book are brought to life on screen with a fabulous cast that is led by Alexander Skarsgard as Brad Colbert, Team Leader.  This series cetainly shows his range as an actor.  He\\'s the \\\\\\\\\"iceman\\\\\\\\\" - calm, tough and calculating, but also shows humor, compassion and downright sadness at times.  We get many glimpses of him behind a large gun and what he conveys with his eyes nothing short of amazing.

Here is one of the great myths of modern man and the Age of Science and Reason; it\\'s a myth that in some respects is even more relevant today with the prospect of widespread genetic engineering. The dream of unlocking the secret of life--and the parallel fear that it might turn into a nightmare remains with us long after Shelley gave it form in this short novel.<br /><br />On the downside, Shelley\\'s prose bears all the faults of the age in which it was composed. *Frankenstein* is almost unbearably overwritten, its characters melodramatically overwrought, and the whole production bathed in the over-the-top hysteria that often typifies Romantic literature. It\\'s comical to hear long eloquent orations delivered by characters in the middle of scenes in which they\\'re literally fighting for their lives--and, indeed, even more ridiculous to hear the monster himself speaking like a Shakespearean actor. To be sure, Shelley\\'s monster is a great deal different than the green-skinned blockhead of the movies, no bolts in his neck, jagged forehead scar, or monosyllabic groans here. This is a pensive, autodidactic monster. Still, the way Shelley envisions him, he\\'s actually far more horrific than Boris Karloff or Herman Munster. Here we have a stitched together assemblage of corpse-parts that the flesh doesn\\'t always entirely cover, leaving the workings of tendons and the like grotesquely exposed to view. He\\'s a wild, ragged, hideous-looking zombie, but not a shambling, sleepwalking, unfeeling drone; instead, he\\'s super-strong, super-agile, super-fast--and he\\'s as eloquent as Cicero.<br /><br />Certainly, Shelley felt it necessary to give the monster a brain and the silver-tongue to express its complex cogitations because *Frankenstein* is, in the end, more a philosophical novel than a tale of horror. What does it mean to be human? Do we overstep our bounds by encroaching on the miracles of life and try to play \\\\\\\\\"god\\\\\\\\\"? Is there a god? Do we not feel pity for the \\\\\\\\\"monster,\\\\\\\\\" which, by its appearance alone, seems to be the embodiment of all we loathe and fear...and yet, in fact, only wants for compassion and companionship to make it \\\\\\\\\"human\\\\\\\\\"? These are the kinds of questions that Shelley asks in *Frankenstein* and to do so she allows her monster to defend himself in the court of ideas like F. Lee Bailey.<br /><br />For that matter, it\\'s somewhat hard to wrap one\\'s mind around the fact that Shelley\\'s Victor Frankenstein begins his work at reanimating corpses while still at college and--instead of the more appropriate middle-aged scientist familiar from innumerable remakes--Dr. Frankenstein in this novel is no older than his mid-20s throughout. Apparently, Shelley herself wasn\\'t yet twenty when originally composing the tale, so that perhaps explains Frankenstein\\'s age here, but it doesn\\'t seem quite right to have him be so young.<br /><br />Still, if you can get past the various absurdities, the purple prose, the frequent repetition, and the more tedious travelogue descriptions of the countrysides of Switzerland, Scotland, the frozen north, etc. there are some genuinely frightening scenes and, more importantly, still-compelling ideas that make Shelley\\'s *Frankenstein* not only the original, but the best elucidation of the myth of the mad man of science and the responsibility of the creator towards ((and for)) that which he creates.

All the danger signs were there - a rushed script because of a writers' strike, threats of Bond going rogue again plus the problem that great Bond films are usually followed by naff ones. The short running time wasn't encouraging, nor the bigger budget and promise of more action.     Well, this isn't one of the great Bond films, and Casino Royale set the bar far too high for it to compete. But it's certainly not a disappointment if you go in aware of that, and more gratifyingly, the similarities to Licence To Kill are superficial. Where Casino Royale was like making love all night long, this is more of a gratifyingly frenzied *beep* of a film. The running time isn't a problem because, like From Russia With Love, this is a pared down machine with no fat to trim away, throwing out all the overused touchstones to get down to business. From a plot point of view there's maybe a little too much one corpse leading to the next plot point in the first third, but the film wisely ditches that approach early.     Dan Bradley's action scenes are thankfully not as ineptly over-edited and incoherent as in Paul Greengrass' films, but aren't as impressive as Gary Powell's work on Casino Royale. There are moments of familiarity - a motorbike sequence borrows from the unimpressively shot harbour scene in Jackie Chan's The Protector, but without the lethargic pacing, while an aeriel dogfight owes a lot to a famously rejected stunt originally intended for the opening of GoldenEye - and the opening car chase through heavy traffic could have benefited from not trying quite so hard. But within them there are moments of stylisation that few other Bonds have attempted and failed at but which are far more successful here, most notably an impressive opera sequence that could have done with a few more shots to clarify the odd mechanical detail (something other parts of the film could benefit from). It's also surprisingly vicious - for perhaps the first time in a Bond film, innocent bystanders are deliberately killed. That said, the rationale for the explosions at the end is more than a little dubious.     The film isn't as humorless as some have complained: there's a lot of dry humor where appropriate and a delightfully playful game of cat-and-mouse with Bond and M in a hotel, but none of the outright slapstick comedy that dragged the series down before. Nor is Forster's direction or the editing as awkward as some found it: there's a pleasingly epic scale to the film allied with a non-nonsense straight-down-to-business attitude that works well for this particular story.     The most curious complaint is that it's just action with no character development, when nothing could be further from the truth. While there is more action, the characterisation is integrated into both plot and action. Bond is once again on an emotional journey - forgiveness, believe it or not, is ultimately the quantum of solace of the title - though this time the heart and soul of the film is Giancarlo Giannini's Rene Mathis, the kind of man Bond might be capable of becoming and one he learns something about himself from. One of their scenes is easily one of the very finest moments in the entire history of the series.     Craig still owns the role impressively and Jeffrey Wright starts to come in to his own as Felix Leiter this time round. Mathieu Amalric is one of the better villains of the past twenty years. He won't be among the greats, but he convinces and the scheme is genuinely ingenious in its simplicity. Olga Kurylenko manages to shake off the ineptness of her former performances to be a more than adequate but not especially memorable female lead, though Gemma Arterton lets the side down badly in a part that has unwelcome elements of Serena Gordon in GoldenEye and Rowan Atkinson in Never Say Never Again. Thankfully it's a small role so her weak and stilted straight-out-of-stage-school acting can't do too much damage.     Intriguingly, the film exists in a more convincing world of global politics than we've seen before in a Bond film: SPECTRE would have loved to be around in an era when governments eagerly step into bed with crime syndicates if it suits their ends and where corporations are able to play governments and intelligence agencies against each other. Here Bond works for a British government that tortures suspects on foreign soil and blindly goes along with foreign interests and crime syndicates alike in its desperation to snatch the scraps from the superpowers' tables. Initially, Bond is just as ruthless and morally flawed as his masters, the bullish arrogance gradually being smoothed away by emotional experience as he learns the importance of forgiveness to find the quantum of solace of the title that he needs to go on.     Yes, there are weaknesses - M's office is overdesigned, a few scenes could have played better, the song is crap and the gunbarrel sequence is a big and unnecessary mistake - but it's not the crushing disappointment some are claiming. It may not be a great Bond movie, but it most definitely is a Bond movie, and a damn good night out at the pictures. And one that left me seriously thinking that even if the series never recaptures the high of Casino Royale,we may just be entering a genuine second golden age of Bond movies.     Although a decent but  unspectacular array of extras have been announced for the two-disc DVD, don't be too surprised if there's a double-dip 3-disc set in a year or so's time as with the recent Casino Royale collector's edition.\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'n03z_H0BANdU85SxOcAF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 14208248, 'review_id': 'RP64JKXSEQDQD', 'product_id': '159448385X', 'product_parent': 801147302, 'product_title': 'A Thousand Splendid Suns', 'product_category': 'Books', 'star_rating': 5, 'helpful_votes': 0, 'total_votes': 0, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'A Thousand Splendid Suns', 'review_body': 'Excellent story, interesting, well written.

It\\'s a hit-record by the numbers, but this is really, REALLY well done.<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"Just Dance\\\\\\\\\" is such an obvious monster at radio that I imagine record company execs were literally drooling over the future numbers -- any song THIS well done can move a million units in re-mixes ALONE. \\\\\\\\\"Poker Face\\\\\\\\\" is double-bridged (using a bridge into chorus and another bridge out of it), \\\\\\\\\"Just Dance\\\\\\\\\" uses a rap in the place of a guitar solo (her own, in one mix, a male voice for the current radio edit) -- again, this is all about harmonic contrast. Some of the songwriting here is remarkably sophisticated, the crux of it is that the sophistication here is used to communicate the simplest of possible messages -- another contrast -- call it poetic contrast, if you like.<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"Just Dance\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"Poker Face\\\\\\\\\" are obvious singles, although \\\\\\\\\"Poker Face\\\\\\\\\" is not your typical single selection due to the incredible degree of songwriting sophistication -- the fidelic qualities aside, here. I do wish Gaga would fade-out the obvious singles instead of hard-stopping everything; some at radio seemed to have re-mixed a fade-out into Gaga\\'s titles themselves, and feels correct for mass market airplay -- and Gaga, if you\\'re reading this, let me say that this feels utterly correct for club-play, as well; it\\'s not exactly a secret that giving the DJ a nice long fade-out to work with makes things a lot easier for the guy spinning the wax at any club, and improves your own spin-count.<br /><br />I notice (welllll... at least I think I notice) that Gaga is sharp enough to keep the bass line slightly leading the drums during choruses, while the bass line seemingly trails the drums during verses -- the choruses thereby seem WONDERFULLY set-off and are some TRUE earworms. Gaga has a voice that seems to be in F, is naturally sharp, and with a natural trill as well as power -- Gaga CAN sing, keys are held and pitches are true, even live (well, from what I\\'ve seen at YouTube so far) -- and is set off, once again, by backing vocals that are male, generally in E or C, generally buried in the mix, used to set-off her own vocals via contrast -- Gaga is clearly the star of this show.<br /><br />The amount of thinking that went into the production here is obvious; this is an absolute monster of a record made by people who clearly know what they are doing. Gaga\\'s look, presence, manner, and sound are the result of an awful lot of thought -- she has everything she needs to be the next generation\\'s Cher, and I mean that in a good way.<br /><br />You know... one more thought: we have had so many years of pop music pretending to be anti-pop; think of the entire grunge movement, for example... that Gaga\\'s timing into the marketplace couldn\\'t have been more perfect: Gaga\\'s quote that pop art, \\\\\\\\\"will never be low-brow,\\\\\\\\\" allows her to actually position herself as a musical anti-hero by firmly embracing the confines of pop AS AN ACT OF REBELLION.

They blew open the door for artists who have experimented with icy electronics while recalling the paranoid frenzy of some of rock and roll\\'s greats; here, then, is the missing link between Unknown Pleasures and Silent Shout.

She is happy to spend her days exploring outside and meeting her new neighbors.  On a rainy day with nothing to do Coraline explores her flat, and discovers a door that opens upon a brick wall. Her mother explains that it was closed up when the house was divided. Fascinated by this door Coraline decides to explore it one day when her dad is too busy working and her mom has gone shopping. Only this time when she opens the door it opens on a flat that is the mirror image of her own. Things seem a lot more fun on this side of the door, everyone is nicer to her, her room is prettier, everyone says her name correctly and even the food is tastier. Except for one problem, Coraline's other mother and other father don't seem to want to let her go back home to her real parents. They want to keep her forever and make her their own little girl.  Worst of all they don't have real eyes, just shiny black button eyes.<br /><br />Lots of creepy little things that go bump in the night populate this book. But the best part of the book is Coraline herself. She is brave, even when she is most afraid; and above all she is clever. She is going to need all of that bravery and all of her brains to get herself back home because her real parents have disappeared and Coraline is the only one who can save them.<br /><br />I can see my children really loving this book when they were younger. It's full of lots of creepy rats, spooky mirrors and mysterious basements, trap doors and a mean `witch'. It's also got a lot of humor in it. It reminded me a lot of Roald Dahl's darker children's books and my girls adored them. It might be a bit scary for really young children but most kids and adults will love it.\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'tE3z_H0BANdU85SxOcAF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 23583073, 'review_id': 'RTNCI26R4W4G1', 'product_id': 'B0019FUFM8', 'product_parent': 733353586, 'product_title': 'The Contract', 'product_category': 'Digital_Video_Download', 'star_rating': 1, 'helpful_votes': 0, 'total_votes': 9, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'Amazon Screws Up Again', 'review_body': \"This is the third movie I've rented based on a trailer that has nothing to do with the movie.

The sound is excellent; and the price for this set was fairly competitive.        The most irritating feature of this set is how the symphonies are cut up, butchered, so that most of them are spread over two discs.  Only Nos 1, 4, 5, and 6, are contained on a single disc.  Strange, since even the longer symphonies, such as No 2 (Resurrection) and No 8 (Of a Thousand) have been released individually on a single CD.      Solti does provide us with some superb interpretations, however.  Symphony No 8 stands out, for example, one of the most difficult concert works to pull together successfully.

This is one of those rare movies that can be enjoyed by fans of the original comic book series and those completely oblivious to the various sub-plots of Batman\\'s legacy.  The acting is largely very well done and most of the story elements are very well put together.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />This installment in the series re-introduces Heath Ledger as \\\\\\\\\"The Joker\\\\\\\\\" in a role that will be often discussed and deservedly so.  But the story is more complex than the Joker alone, and plays on the various psychological games that he plays on Gotham\\'s various groups, including the public, the police, organized crime and Batman himself.  In that sense, there is a great deal of depth to the story that makes it easy to suspend disbelief considering not everybody is quick to believe comic-book plot-lines.<br /><br />But there are also several unanswered questions about the story and the fates of some of its characters.  Long time Batman fans will be more aware of some of the minor departures from the original stories, but it\\'s impossible to discuss them without spoiling the plot.  By and large, the areas where the story is altered are well done.  Just be prepared for some nagging questions at the end that are certain to be answered by one or more sequels.<br /><br />THE CAST<br /><br />The casting is top notch.  Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Christian Bale and Gary Oldman turn in great performances in their roles, mostly static carry-overs from \\\\\\\\\"Batman Begins.\\\\\\\\\"  And Aaron Eckhart is wonderful in his role as Harvey Dent, so much so that he could have certainly been nominated for several awards as well. But perhaps the one role that I was not entirely happy with was that of Rachel, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.  While she is certainly a capable actress, I found most of her scenes showed little range or emotion.  I have to wonder if the part was written that way or if she simply underplayed the role.  In any case, these are very small details considering that her role is still serviceable and doesn\\'t detract from the story.<br /><br />THE CAMERA WORK AND SOUND<br /><br />The other element that should be considered with this movie is the extremely dark colors and shadows used throughout the film, perhaps to symbolic effect.  \\\\\\\\\"Batman Begins\\\\\\\\\" was very dark, but this takes that morbid darkness to another level.  The camera work and lighting are excellent.  But the quality of your home screen will greatly influence your ability to appreciate the visuals of this movie.  Be prepared to watch this movie in absolute darkness.  Also be ready for a sound mix that alternates somewhat between low dialogue and the loud sounds of gunfire and explosions.<br /><br />THE SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />The Two-Disc Special Edition includes some extras and a \\\\\\\\\"Digital Copy,\\\\\\\\\" a convenient way to get a DRM accepted version of the film for your mobile devices.  You still have to enter in a special code, which is included, in order to obtain and access the copy.<br /><br />There are also six individual scenes from the IMAX wide-screen, though you have to play them one by one.  Standard galleries are included with production stills and poster art. We also have the \\\\\\\\\"Gotham Tonight\\\\\\\\\" news features with surprise appearances by none other than Anthony Michael Hall.  Those features are actually great to watch with those less familiar with the Batman story before watching the movie.<br /><br />The \\\\\\\\\"Gotham Uncovered\\\\\\\\\" extra includes two parts: \\\\\\\\\"The Evolution of the Knight\\\\\\\\\" covers some of the details on the new suit and Bat-pod, and \\\\\\\\\"The Sound of Anarchy\\\\\\\\\" includes a nice discussion on the score as created by Hans Zimmer, which is very good. The thing that I noticed most about \\\\\\\\\"The Sound of Anarchy\\\\\\\\\" is Hans Zimmer\\'s impressive editing and mixing workstation.<br /><br />But the extras of disk two may still fall short of the impressive extras that were included with the [[ASIN:B0017HPHBM Batman Begins (Limited Edition Gift Set)]].  So while this is still a very good release, many will want to buy the widescreen edition for now and save their money for the next special edition that is likely to come or the Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This film is an achievement.  I only wish that I could have seen it in the IMAX release. This may be a movie worth upgrading to high-definition Blu-Ray for. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Enjoy.good release, many will want to buy the widescreen edition for now and save their money for the next special edition that is likely to come or the Blu-Ray release.

At that time I was still not entirely comfortable with the English language, and I was going through the library picking up easy books to read, which usually tend to be in the fantasy section. The kind of books where a young boy is helped by a wizard and some other mythological creatures to become all he can be... a king or hero of some sort.  So, it was by pure chance that I picked up GRRM's masterpiece. My only regret is that I did not play the lottery that day.  That summer day, I embarked on one of the most rewarding reading experiences of my life.<br /><br />There is not much I can say about this book that hasn't been said already.  Its epic scope is unparalleled; its characterization is far superior to any in fantasy, and in par with the best fiction of any genre; and Martin's style of writing creates the perfect balance between grand storytelling and individual examination. There is such a vivid description of everything from the terrain, the castles and cities, and the people...so so many people; I have to look back at War and Peace to come up with comparative dramatis personae.  The very thought that such an intricate world could really be encompassed by a fantasy writer is audacious. However, Martin did not just whip the Seven Kingdoms out of thin air. In fact, there are many real-life historical correlations to the world where the story is set, starting with the very map (which you can try and figure out with a mirror or a bit of imagination).  But do not be fooled, this is not historical fiction, nor would I say this is fantasy.  What GRRM has done, is create his own genre, fantasy so real that it transcends the genre, and puts swords and sorcery, albeit a large dose of the first and minimal sprinklings of the second, to the forefront of contemporary fiction.<br /><br />Believe the hype, for it really is as good as it sounds.  I purposefully will not give away any plot related information, because I think this book should be read with as little foreknowledge as possible, for that way, with every turn of the page you will be amazed. It is probably best if I provide a personal example.  I have a very long list of books that I intend to read, on top of that I have an exhaustive curriculum in grad school, and yet I found the time to re-read Game of Thrones ten years later, not simply to refresh my memory, but because when a tapestry is as rich as the one that Martin weaves, one can't help but admire its beauty time and time again.ion, because I think this book should be read with as little foreknowledge as possible, for that way, with every turn of the page you will be amazed.

Lionel Shriver doesn't try to *trick* or talk down to the reader. She has created a character (Eva) who is not only brutally honest, but makes no apologies. Eva is not a sympathetic character and I really appreciated that. A book about 'blah blah blah - violence in schools - blah blah blah - why why why?' could so easily have been cliche but Shriver takes a completely different approach to an already overplayed topic. What if your child is truly a bad seed? What if his sociopathic tendencies have been so cleverly executed that your family thinks you are the crazy one and not your son? Eva talks at length, honestly and openly, about how from the minute her son was born she never felt an attachment to him. She never directly questions why her son did what he did. In many ways, she is as emotionally cold and detached as Kevin. Even her relationship with her daughter is without extreme emotion. What makes this book so creepy is that Eva never truly makes the connection just how alike she and her son are. Also, I liked that Kevin did not fall into the stereotype of 'school shooter'. Even better, he didn't use a gun. He's a very interesting character study -- not your typical 'oh poor me, the world is out to get me, i wear trench coats and black coats to stand out and I have access to a gun' character. Shriver has created a sociopath who deserves his own follow up novel.<br />I never thought that Eva's journey was cathartic nor did I think that Shriver was disguising the fact that the letters Eva writes were to her deceased husband. I think Eva wanted to put her journey in writing in hopes of having a better understanding. There is no answer to why kids act the way they do. And Kevin is an entirely different breed of interesting and terrifying kid. Eva has nothing left to lose, so through her letters she can express the utmost honesty. I believe that she did love her husband, but Shriver never makes this relationship overdramtic, in keeping with Eva's nature.ic, in keeping with Eva's nature.\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': '003z_H0BANdU85SxOcAF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 33946943, 'review_id': 'R24MA75KGJ9YIO', 'product_id': '1401219268', 'product_parent': 777411096, 'product_title': 'Watchmen', 'product_category': 'Books', 'star_rating': 5, 'helpful_votes': 0, 'total_votes': 1, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': True, 'review_headline': 'Watchmen Novel - amazing', 'review_body': 'I am very excited for the movie as from the previews it appears to hold VERY true to the original Gibbons graphic novel.

Here\\'s one interesting tidbit.    I have an early pressing of the CD, before \\\\\\\\\"Endless, Nameless\\\\\\\\\" was added at the end as a bonus track.  The credits state: \\\\\\\\\"All song lyrics by Kurt Cobain / Music by Nirvana.\\\\\\\\\"  This was still in the early Geffen days when they decided to split compositional credit equally.    Once it became obvious to Kurt just how big Nirvana was going to be, he forced a contract change which required the majority of all compositional credit to be given exclusively to him, both going forward and retroactively.  The implication is that he felt he did most of the creative work anyway, and he would quit the band if the other members did not agree.  Newer pressings, probably including the one offered new on Amazon, will give full musical credit to Kurt for everything except \\\\\\\\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\\\\\\\\", where he graciously allowed the other guys to retain their share.    Maybe Kurt was the driving force behind these songs.  Maybe Krist and Dave did little more but help arrange the bass and drum parts for the tunes that Kurt wrote.  It\\'s just amazing that such a development would occur after an album has been released, which is when most people would think that these issues have already been decided for perpetuity.  After all, he couldn\\'t gather up all of the old pressings and exchange them.

At that time, Paramount Pictures was looking for a movie that could compete with Warner Brothers' release of the new Batman movie, starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. Paramount was hoping, this latest edition of the Star Trek movies, would do the job. Their plans backfired! Batman was well received and did exetremely well at the Box Office. If Star Trek V had been given more time during production and released at a later date, I believe the movie would have been better received. The weakiness in the movie, was the script and with the sub-par special effects. Star Trek's appeal to its fan base, has always been, its special effects. If Industrial Light & Magic had done the special effects for this installment of Star Trek, the movie would have been better received. The storyline involving the Klingons, could have been better defined. The strengths of the movie, focused on the main characters, especially Kirk, Spock & McCoy. The other strength, was Lawrence Luckinbill's portrayal of Sybok. His portrayal of Spock's full blooded Vulcan brother, was excellent. With Sybok's telepathic powers, Kirk,Spock and McCoy, had to deal with the demons of their past,including Spock's inner conflict regarding his mixed heritage. The end of the movie, should have been on the lines of classic Star Trek. The Enterprise's return to Spacedock complete its refit would have more appropriate than a camp fire scene at Yosemite National Park.

After finding out the legendary Joe Bob Briggs had done a couple films in the series on Monstervision way back when we figured it was a no brainer. Now 70's horror is really hit or miss but luckily this one was pretty creepy.<br /><br />The film is based around 2 brothers Mike and Jody. Mike is the younger pain in the a** brother that follows big bro Jody around all the time. While being the little peep freak he is he spies on Jody as he attends a friends funeral only to see something odd. Once everyone has left he notices some really tall man, known as the Tall Man, taking the 500lb casket and launching it into the back of his hearst with ease. Now Mike and Jody go on a hunt of the mortician tall man and get themselves and their friends into a real mess. See the tall man doesn't play that game and sends his back of zombie elves, no relation to Sid, and a sweet flying orb that drills through skulls after the dynamic duo. The films really is all over the place and backs plenty of odd imagery. There were many times we looked at each other and wondered what the hell is going on? It may have been our current state of mind but we're pretty sure this one is tweaked to the max. Just right for the occasion.<br /><br />Overall the film was a fun watch. There were certainly some scares and moments of sheer confusion which adds up to what we're looking for in a b horror. It also had the Tall Man which promises to freak anybody out. The guy is like 8 ft tall and has all sorts of crazy powers. Someone you do not want to mess with. This is a guy that Santa would see coming and destroy a pair of FTL's only to swing them in a clear garbage bag overhead. We have to say this one is worth checking out.

Romero takes writing duties(based on Stephen King stories) and the directing is left to Romero\\'s DP, Michael Gornick.  It only has 3 stories instead of 5 and seems to be missing that tongue in cheek touch of the first film.<br />But I still love the movie!  The first story is about a cigar store wooden Indian that comes to life for some Charles Bronson-esque revenge when some hoodlums rob the general store and kill the owner, played by George Kennedy(\\\\\\\\\"Be sure...Breath Assure!\\\\\\\\\") and his wife.  The second story comes from King\\'s short story collection, Skeleton Crew.  It\\'s about two couples that drive out to a lake in October to swim out to a wooden raft in the middle of the lake.  Why?  I\\'ve never been quite sure.  You practically get cold watching them.  Once on the raft they are attacked by a round, black water creature that looks like a garbage bag half submerged in the water.  Like The Blob, it\\'s hungry and eats anyone it can grab, or whoever gets too close to it.  The third story has a snooty, rich Lois Chiles hitting a hitchhiker on the highway.  She flees the scene, but the dead dude simply isn\\'t gonna leave her alone, and she engages in a war/chase with the zombie-like hitchhiker.<br />Like the first film, these three stories are supposed to be from a comic book, but they are linked together by animated sequences involving Billy(the boy with the Creepshow comic in the first film) being harassed by bullies and getting his revenge.  Also in the animated sequences is \\\\\\\\\"The Creep\\\\\\\\\", a kind of Cryptkeeper character who introduces the stories.  This animation is the cause of some of the criticism of this movie.  I don\\'t mind it terribly, but it is kinda unnecessary and seems there only to pad out running time.  If you ask me, the three stories are all rather solid.  A lot of folks don\\'t particularly care for the first story, but in the immortal words of Meatloaf, \\\\\\\\\"Two out of three ain\\'t bad\\\\\\\\\".  I actually like that first story very much.  \\\\\\\\\"The Raft\\\\\\\\\" is a great little tale that could have even made it into the first film.  Though it changes King\\'s story a bit, it keeps the spirit of the story for sure(the Blob/garbage bag monster in the story had swirling colors in it\\'s body that had a hypnotic, druglike effect on those who looked at it.  There was some sex and a different ending as well.  But the ending was anticlimactic for a film.  The movie\\'s ending was great.).

(Kinsella\\'s latest novel) a while back when it first came out.  This is the book that introduced me to the genre of chick lit, and I greatly enjoyed it.  Perhaps Lexi Smart wasn\\'t the deepest of characters, but the majority of the book was an unfolding of her discovering what it is she really wants out of life, mixed in with some very original humor to keep the pace going.    Confessions of a Shopaholic is NOTHING like that.  I admit I never finished the novel because after reading a particularly despicable act on the main character\\'s part, I got off the train at Penn station and threw it in the trash.  I have never not finished a book out of sheer disgust ... and interestingly enough, I fell into a deep relaxation afterwards knowing that I would never have to deal with Rebecca Bloomwood\\'s retarded problems ever again.    The whole book reads like one car crash after another.  The main character is obviously mentally unstable and a pathological liar, which I found neither funny nor endearing as the author seemed to have intended.  The typical situation in the book plays out like this:  Rebecca sees store, Rebecca goes in and buys too much, Rebecca berates herself, Rebecca goes into deep played-out delusion about how she\\'ll hit the lottery jackpot, win at the casino, marry rich, etc etc etc ... , Rebecca\\'s bubble bursts by some way too obvious event, Rebecca goes into an internal panic attack of massive proportions, Rebecca conjures up new way to lie to her friends, family, coworkers, and so on, to make herself feel better.  For about a hundred pages in the middle of the book this whole cycle goes from start to end every two paragraphs.  I\\'m not kidding. I lost count of how many mini-meltdowns our \\\\\\\\\"heroine\\\\\\\\\" had.  Not to mention that after the first few chapters there\\'s nothing that comes out of this girl\\'s mouth that isn\\'t a lie.  It was the epitome of exhausting and disturbing at the same time ... I got a little more than 2/3rds in before I realized life is too short.    I suppose the first couple of chapters were mildly amusing ... seeing a glimpse of what someone who\\'s in financial trouble goes through.  But the humor stopped after realizing the main character\\'s a pretty horrible person in general.  I reckon I read in other reviews that the story wraps up with her getting her dreams come true, getting a hot rich boyfriend, all for not reason, blah blah blah, no repercussions, blah blah boring!  I won\\'t even go into how laughably bland and alike every single character in this story is.   I just hope that the movie is only loosely based on the novel because the message doesn\\'t need to be going out to the masses that it is cute and socially acceptable for young women to be idiots about their finances and unbearably selfish with their loved ones.      The author can do much better than this, so go read Remember Me?; an immensely more well-written story with a better plot line to boot than this garbage.', 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'FE3z_H0BANdU85SxOcEF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 52976583, 'review_id': 'R6016TKUJC3QD', 'product_id': 'B0015OKWL2', 'product_parent': 904939428, 'product_title': 'Righteous Kill', 'product_category': 'Video DVD', 'star_rating': 4, 'helpful_votes': 0, 'total_votes': 0, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'Decent', 'review_body': 'No, this is not \\\\\\\\\"Heat Part 2\\\\\\\\\", but it\\'s not bad.

But the main reason to watch the movie though is its huge fantastic battles, lots of wonderful blood and gore, strange alien bugs, a little bit more blood and gore, phenomenal special effects, some more blood and gore, a body count in the thousands if not the millions, and even more blood and gore. Did I mention the blood and gore? Starship Troopers has been compared favorably to \\\\\\\\\"Saving Private Ryan\\\\\\\\\" in its Hack-Factor, that is it\\'s mind-numbing violence. The humans have machine guns, nukes, and plasma cannons. The bugs too have plasma cannons, a flame thrower that shoots out their noses, but mostly they have sharp pincers. While a human must blow multiple parts off a bug to kill it, splattering everything with orange or green guts and goo, the bug will stab humans through the chest, lop off heads, bite off legs and rip bodies in two.

Also, the POV feels slightly off balance, with Nasuada and Saphira's POV chapters placed, seemingly, where they would save the most plotting work, rather than where they would be the most meaningful. Most of the side characters in this book also fall short of the previous books' standard(though not all of them), and the new villains are even worse. Nearly everything feels dry and overworked, contrasting the freshness(if not utter originality) in the previous books. The lack of new places and serious new characters is part of this. Also, the explanation for Murtagh and Thorn's enhanced power really comes up lame; it may work in the next book, but it's melodramatic and anticlimactic for now.   In all Brisingr just doesn't have the level of heart and character of the previous two. The good moments in this book do live up to the previous books - there just aren't enough of them.    Pluses: Even though so much of the book feels stale, Eragon still feels like the same person, as do Saphira(except during her POV passages) and Arya. The parts highlighting these characters are the highlights of the book. Brisingr also has a good string of smaller conflicts going on, especially with Eragon trying to get a new sword and the ever-widening number of promises he makes. Overall its very recognizable as part of the same story, while still managing to bring in a few good new things.

The stories don't really need much praise here (except that I confess to finding Little Pig Robinson a rather dull, waffling book that was written during Potter's later years), but still this boxed set is well worth its price. I know it's a hundred dollars and more expensive than the omnibus edition of the tales, but you can really savour the original format of the books. The stores unfold gracefully and the format is more pleasing to the eye, as it's perhaps more organised than the cumbersome omnibus edition. Of course, the illustrations are so very picture-perfect, and the reproductions make them look more vivid than ever. A minor quibble is about the six extra illustrations in Peter Rabbit, as they have made the story drag a little as compared to the final published version we know now. That said, I enjoy this new set tremendously, as it's well-produced on the whole, with nice paper and a new font that is more pleasing to the eye. And the box is really a nice touch too.

The brass section was in these recordings in very bad condition. In that period Jochum recorded Beethoven with the London Symphony and Brahms with the London Philharmonic.I know many readers will blame me but I really think that it would have been much better to record Bruckner with one of these orchestras. This set has many fans between those who have no basis of comparison and praise this cheap but poor issue as a milestone of the discography.  I have to say that to my ears is unbearable to hear Bruckner, who needs an organ-like brass section, played with such a strained brass sound and with so  many grotesque flops (in a studio recording!)  I like Jochum's fervour too, but his intentions where impossible to realize for evident technical limitations. The sound of the trumpets is very strained since the first bars of every symphony. Take the climax of the first movement of the 8th,where the trumpets sound terribly strained and out of tune. The first movement of the 6th where the trumpets are exposed is disastrous,the final bars of the 8th are full of  enthusiasm but the brass are forced to die. The climax of the adagio of the 7th is reached with effort and the sublime following bars close to the coda ,dedicated do Wagner,are again spoiled by clumsy trumpets. Sadly the list of examples would be overlong, everywhere there are trumpets flaws. With adequate trumpets the 5th could have been a magnificent recording,thanks to Jochum's grand and poetical vision(how beautiful are the introduction to the first movement,the development,and the entire second movement! The strings are dreamy).  According to my opinion, the Staatskapelle Dresden gloriously sounding in almost all the romantic repertoire,with  superb strings, sadly had not a brass section in condition to play Bruckner safely at the time of these recordings.  Jochum is very intense,even more than in his first cycle, but the technical problems of the brass  destroy many of the beautiful moments he tried to create, and his demanding crescendos and stringendos are realized with embarassing efforts. The recorded sound is also quite unattractive.  Between the sets of Bruckner symphonies,let alone the legendary 3-9 Celibidache/Emi,I find excellent the 3 cycles recorded by Asahina,an impressive recent issue is with Paternostro(Antes)- despite a few serious orchestral mistakes(but these are live recordings)it is a successful cycle,in opulent sound,with a wonderful 8th- . Chailly's set is also fine, very well played and recorded.The set of the young Haitink for Philips is after around 50 years still highly raccomandable.  But if you are also interested in separate Bruckner cds,there are many successful recordings with Giulini,Wand,Haitink. It is interesting for me to make a comparison with the magnificent recordings of Sinopoli and the same orchestra of Jochum-Emi 20 years later in a much better form and particularly with  Haitink's  majestic 8th Hass ed.- issued in 2009 by Profil- a 2002 live recording,with splendid Dresden brass, sounding as glorious as the strings! The actual condition of Dresden is superb, incomparable with that of the time of Jochum's recording.  Regarding Jochum, run to buy his marvellous live recordings in Japan(Altus): a fantastic long breathed 7th with the Concertgebow and a dramatic 8th with Bamberg,and don't forget the two live 5ths with the Concertgebow!(Philips and Thara)\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'KU3z_H0BANdU85SxOcEF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 21857895, 'review_id': 'R29GSY4B94678U', 'product_id': 'B00129H7VS', 'product_parent': 755132112, 'product_title': 'Band of Brothers [Blu-ray]', 'product_category': 'Video DVD', 'star_rating': 5, 'helpful_votes': 2, 'total_votes': 3, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'Incredible', 'review_body': 'Own on DVD as well- Bluray version is incredible!

Black Cat: Mira wasn\\'t as prominently featured last time so she takes the reins on this one and it\\'s basically her singing almost flatly while co-vocalist Helen Marnie chimes in with a great melody now and then. With bouncy production and a catchy synth line, this isn\\'t as hard rocking as \\\\\\\\\"High Rise\\\\\\\\\" but still works great. 9/10    Ghosts: Similar to \\\\\\\\\"Sugar\\\\\\\\\", this first single is meant to hook you in by having a chorus sung fairly often and the \\\\\\\\\"there\\'s a ghost in me/who wants to say I\\'m sorry/doesn\\'t mean I\\'m sorry\\\\\\\\\" line will easily get stuck in your head.  Though not as repetitive as Sugar...at least until the end chorus anyway, the driving bass line and Helen\\'s vocals make this a keeper. 9/10    I\\'m Not Scared:  One word to describe this track would probably be \\\\\\\\\"energetic\\\\\\\\\".  The drums and instruments create almost an ideal track for barreling down the highway at top speeds and of course Helen\\'s vocals are always awesome. That guitar solo is pretty ace too, though slightly buried in the mix. 8.5/10    Runaway: Another single and like \\\\\\\\\"Ghosts\\\\\\\\\" the line is just simply \\\\\\\\\"my little runaway\\\\\\\\\" however it\\'s used a bit too extensively. While it\\'s ideal for the dance floor where you\\'re not noticing it, the line is repeated a bit too often.  But there is a great beat the percussion adds and despite the gripe, the chorus is catchy indeed. 8/10    Seasons of Illusions:A Mira track and I actually grew to like it after awhile. A strange synth sound kind of dominates the whole thing and Helen adds some lovely background vocals. Only thing about the song is like most Mira songs, the songs don\\'t, shall we say, explode or do something that takes the song from great to flat-out awesome. 7.5/10    Burning Up: Helen\\'s vocals sound strangely echo-y but the track as a whole is like a lot of tracks on the album: very \\\\\\\\\"full\\\\\\\\\" sounding with big percussion but it\\'s such a lively and catchy track that it becomes a highlight. Kind of lurches at the end though. 7/10    Kletva: A Mira track and it\\'s another oddity, one of those tracks where it\\'s hard to latch onto though musically it\\'s nicely varied with so much going on at once, \\\\\\\\\"wall of sound\\\\\\\\\" doesn\\'t quite cut it. Only thing that knocks it is that there\\'s no real vocal melody or really anything to hook into. 6/10    They Gave You a Heart, They Gave You a Name: Very punchy and lively track and the interplay between Mira and Helen works quite well whereas in most songs they either sing solo or just do the occasional background vocal like Black Cat. The \\\\\\\\\"lay down beside me\\\\\\\\\" is a good hook to get stuck in your head. 8/10    Predict the Day: I don\\'t really know what to think of this one. It starts with very loud percussion and a whistling tune almost straight out of a Sergio Leone film. It\\'s a nice change of pace from the hyper energy tracks but it\\'s maybe a bit...too strange for some. At least this one adds a new whistle for you when you\\'re out walking. 6.5/10    The Lovers:  Propulsive is the word here as it\\'s almost relentless and Helen\\'s vocals are quite good though at times she\\'s a bit buried and makes her hard to understand but then again, most of the tracks have that. Only thing about the track is that it\\'s fairly short so it\\'s hard to say whether it ends too early or it\\'s the perfect length. 7/10    Deep Blue: Mira returns with her usual flat singing which of course works very well. I actuallyquite enjoyed the track and while the \\\\\\\\\"deep blue I want to give it all to you, deep blue I know it scares you\\\\\\\\\" hook is repeated a fair bit, the track is pretty sweet but then it hits a whole other stratosphere when Helen\\'s vocals come in. Stellar moment when done live. My complaint? She comes in at the last literal minute. Bah. 9/10    Tomorrow: Helen\\'s vocals have a nice dreamy quality during the chorus which almost makes me think of \\\\\\\\\"Whitelightgenerator\\\\\\\\\" from last record though the track\\'s a bit more energetic and has a nice dream-pop quality to it. Hm, that song was also 2nd-to-last track too and this one is as well. Anyway it\\'s a track well worth a checking out. 8.5/10    Versus: Instead of the quiet subdued \\\\\\\\\"All the Way\\\\\\\\\", we have a near-epic. It\\'s a bit long (few hairs short of 6 minutes) but the sound of it just gives it a very rich and full experience and makes for a big fat finale. Only strange thing is there\\'s a male background singer with her which is a nice idea but I don\\'t like how their voices sound together. The vocalist of Stars for example (Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan) sound perfect together. Helen and Daniel Hunt don\\'t all that well. Still nice closer though. 8/10    Only thing that knocks Velocifero down from Witching Hour is diversity in that tracks on this one are either high energy or just odd and something like a Beauty #2 or a fun ditty like The Last One Standing would\\'ve given this a nice mixture but as it is, this is a great release and well worth the time.', 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'Mk3z_H0BANdU85SxOcEF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 12531012, 'review_id': 'RX57ENQPB422T', 'product_id': '0385720920', 'product_parent': 729613164, 'product_title': 'Choke', 'product_category': 'Books', 'star_rating': 5, 'helpful_votes': 1, 'total_votes': 4, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'Excellent!', 'review_body': \"Everything was smooth and perfect!

Yet despite all this, the book still feels incredibly relevant in today\\'s times. Actually even more relevant as America wakes up to a crisis of confidence in Wall Street.     Almost all characters in this book are contemptible, save for maybe the Lamb kid (although even his wholesome personae is overblown), the little daughter, and the defense lawyer. Yet none of these people are the stars of the book. The real players: Sherman, Bacon, Kramer, and Fallow are incredibly smarmy in their respective fields. You can\\'t root for any of them. Did you want Sherman to win his case or not? Wolfe clearly had a real disdain for these characters and so too did I. But I kind of liked this. I couldn\\'t root for anyone and it kept me on my literary toes.     The only observation that kept running through my head while reading this book was that Bacon, Kramer, and Fallow all had to metaphorically or actually tear down alpha male Sherman in order to feel better about themselves. To that end, I think this book is just as much about American male egotism as it is about anything else.

His stunners have left no doubt that he can poke into a subculture and emerge with a fresh new look at it. But Slumdog goes one better. It is pitch-perfect in its take, but also perhaps his most accessible endeavor thus far.<br /><br />The narrative couches a crisp homage to Bollywood. Funky A.R.Rehman music. A largely Indian crew. Crisp acting, even from kids, in fact especially from kids. And then the gloriously larger-than-life thematic flourishes: poor folks at the behest of a cruel world, friend pitted against friend, brother against brother--and the most tried and tested one of all-- a rags to riches cavalcade of an underprivileged hero who makes it amid impossible odds. It\\'s hero-giri alright.<br /><br />But where it departs from Bollywood is Simon Beaufoy\\'s screenplay. It\\'s dazzling. Professional Indian reviewers have been overly delicate in their reference to Vikas Swarup\\'s novel that inspired the film, \\\\\\\\\"Q & A\\\\\\\\\". The book was an enjoyable read, but the film merely borrows the central premise and that\\'s basically it. There is a scene towards the end with our two protagonists at a train station where a trick of reverse cutting will tell a discerning viewer just how innovative the thinking behind the screenplay truly is--that is such a sweet, affectionate shot that it moistened my eyes.<br /><br />It\\'s a bummer that such fuss and to-do has been made about how this film projects an unfair image of the country. Guess the confusion arises when established reviewers such as Roger Ebert decide to call it a testament to \\\\\\\\\"the real India\\\\\\\\\". I wouldn\\'t be so pedantic. To me, the film carries no such delusions of grand purpose. It\\'s a gleeful entertainer. A breakneck story of one individual from *one* aspect of an astonishingly multifaceted country. To that extent, it covers its subject with addicting vigor and focus. It\\'s witty, gritty, and--for suitable values thereof--sh*tty.<br /><br />To address some petty cavils:<br /><br />(1) The use of English by the characters. It\\'s a British production, what did you expect. There\\'s a world outside a specific country. We call it \\\\\\\\\"International Cinema\\\\\\\\\". Bet there will be local dubbed versions for those who truly desire it that way (now that the film\\'s multitude of nominations have drawn it far away from a SlumUnderdog status).<br /><br />(2) The disrespectful use of the word \\\\\\\\\"dog\\\\\\\\\" in the title. This smacks of nothing but ignorance of colloquialisms. \\\\\\\\\"Word up, dawg\\\\\\\\\", for instance? People forget that an insult becomes an insult only when we choose to let it become one.<br /><br />(3) Finally, the unfairness of how it depicts India in a manner that might give people the WrongIdea. To these Einsteins may I point out that the baffling kaleidoscope we call India makes it pretty hard to ever get the RightIdea to begin with?<br /><br />What level of dimness would make a viewer go seeking a wholesome view of a country in *one* film? Just because \\\\\\\\\"The Godfather\\\\\\\\\" showed with such pizzazz one specific aspect of the American underworld, should we infer that every American is a gun-slinging gangster? \\\\\\\\\"Crouching Tiger..\\\\\\\\\" may have sketched a mellifluous perspective of China, but I don\\'t recall anyone thinking that our Chinese colleagues fly from tree to tree on their way to work. And so on.<br /><br />It\\'s a movie, not a national treatise. Sure, it depicts poverty. So? Those who have expanded their horizons beyond Spiderman Part 38 will know that countless movies have been made in the last decade alone that depict hard times in *every* country. At any rate, reality is nothing but a collectively accepted notion. I\\'d say Slumdog is as equidistant from reality as, say, Bollywood\\'s gigantic palaces (yeah, we live that way) or the scantily-clad \\\\\\\\\"item girls\\\\\\\\\" gyrating on snow-capped mountains.<br /><br />To people who have yet to see this upbeat thriller: ignore all the Pavlovian drivel.

The story is all from her point of view and perspective of this world. She describes the community and culture in such a believable way that you can imagine being there. She creates stories and strategizes on what it might be like for the others in her community and later uses that skill to help her to compete in the Hunger Games.     Her world is filled with the normal young adult concerns and struggles and then her life is suddenly changed when she becomes a competitor for District Twelve to the Hunger games. The competitors are called Tributes. One boy and one girl tribute from each of the twelve districts is selected to play this yearly game. It's fascinating to see this world that sort of resembles today and how it has changed and morphed into something else. People and their behavior are transcendent regardless of their environment.

'Changeling' is the story of a single mother whose son is kidnapped by a ruthless child predator, and her fight to see his return despite the LAPD's attempts to deem her insane when she denies the young boy they push upon her is hers.<br /><br />The story is very interesting, and while the film starts out slow, it quickly gains momentum once she discovers her son is missing.  From the police investigation to her caring for the son that is not hers, to her being confined to an asylum for refusing to cooperate with the police department and the secrets revealed about the inmates' incarcerations, to the hunt for the man responsible and everything about him...it was just, at best I can describe it, a thrill ride.  I wasn't expecting it, but it put me in the mind of 'Silence of the Lambs' during some parts of the movie, in particular the search for the kidnapper.<br /><br />The movie is long I should warn.  Almost 3 hours if not, but once you invest your time into it, you won't notice as I didn't.  The ending was a bit surprising to me, but I was thankful that it wasn't predicatable or conventional, and just as thankful that I didn't do any research on the actual events.  I thought the cinematography was awesome, and this was by far some of the best acting I've seen from Angelina Jolie since 'A Mighty Heart.'  Clint Eastwood once again delivers and shows that there is nothing that he can't do.

We are entering a progressive descent into some kind of hell but we go down one step at a time without knowing there will be more steps after this one. This descent is represented in the film by the steps going up to the house behind the motel, then the steps going up and down from one level of the cabins to the next, then the staircase inside the house going up to the rooms but also going down to the fruit cellar. This image, which is a metaphor of the mind when it is swallowed up by insanity, is essential and cannot be in color because an insane mind is a whole set of hues and shades of grey. But Hitchcock in this case constructs the plot itself that way. Sexual temptation for the boy friend, then mutual and reciprocal financial temptation for the money and the girl, then the run, the escape. And then one step at a time the trail is getting hotter and hotter. The boss seeing her driving out of town. The cop finding her asleep in her car on the shoulder of a road. The cop following her and observing her swapping her car for another. The motel to escape the rain and get some rest. The sandwich and the milk, the discussion and the mental trap for her, the poor thief, and for him the poor surviving son. And you can go on and on and that will lead you to the end, but with only one question in your mind. How is it possible that such doom can fall upon someone? But who is that someone? The son, Norman Bates, a killer of his own mother and her lover who was left free to survive in society? The poor thief Marion Crane who was trusted with the un-trustable, so much money that her jaws fell down? There is in this film, maybe more than in most Hitchcock's films, the sense of some kind of doom or fate or destiny governed and controlled by some kind of insane authority. Hitchcock was showing then the God he never alluded to in this film that was governing this world must have gone not AWOL as some may say but insane, frankly schizophrenic. For this sinister world to make sense, you need to state that the master mind of our cosmos is a double personality, good old god on one side and good old satan on the other side and the fight between the two are not even close to the beginning of an end and our lot will be like that tossed from the benevolent hand of god into the malevolent hand of satan and/or vice versa as many times as these two will find some pleasure in doing so, as long as we will not cut the branches and the roots of this divine and devilish schizophrenia that is finding its source in our very flesh and mind and that is outsourced by our spirit or brain into some autonomous though totally virtual, an absolute simulacrum, of reality, an outsourcing movement that gives us the illusion of sanity paid for by that mental and spiritual alienation that the invention of these two supernatural beings represents for us. Better be alienated in spirituality than divided in reality. That explains so well the fact that such lines of thinking and representing our own experiential life can lead to all kinds of possible bigotry and fundamentalism, as soon as we decide we are standing on the only side worth it, that is to say the side of good, the side of god, the side of light, without understanding that there are so many shades of light and so many hues of shade that if we all stand one-sided and one-spirited and one-minded for what each one of us consider as pure light we are absolutely doomed to commit our daily genocide every day between our morning shower and our breakfast, just as an appetizer for our day of labor. And Hitchcock builds that fate upside down for the poor Marion Crane: the genocide of Norman Bates' mother happens between Marion Crane's evening snack and her before-going-to-bed shower, a shower she will never finish taking and that will be turned into a long bath in some muddy pond. The final and concluding image of the car containing the body and the money being pulled out of the pond is the wink Hitchcock addresses to us for us to go back in time and enjoy the film as a rotten metonymy of real life. He even imposes onto us a five minutes psychological ranting discourse from the local psychiatrist to convince us that all is normal since everything is upside down, but is it? Is it not the reverse: everything is upside down since all is normal, or is it everything is normal because all is upside down, or whatever? Add a touch of color to that film and you will produce a big meaningless mess. Black, white and grey become death so well, just like mourning becomes Elektra.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesontaining the body and the money being pulled out of the pond is the wink Hitchcock addresses to us for us to go back in time and enjoy the film as a rotten metonymy of real life.

I\\'m happy as a clam!  Not only is the remastered sound quality top notch (just as the first three reissues were), the packaging should win an award.  When fans are hoping a \\\\\\\\\"deluxe\\\\\\\\\" reissue of a classic meets their expectations, this one is a prime example of how to appease, (I was SO hoping the label would go so far as to recreate the original red velvet jacket and BY GOLLY THEY DID!).  Not only that but I get a sticker and a poster in the package as well, are you kidding me?!      First off, this reissue sounds amazing!  Details previously lurking in the background of the original vinyl release now come to life like never before!  And this remastered version has provided a major breakthrough for me as a fan of this album, my ears have FINALLY opened to the three orchestral instrumental pieces featured.  I bought my first used vinyl copy of this album in 1997 and almost always skipped over the instrumentals.  To these ears, not one of them \\\\\\\\\"delivered\\\\\\\\\" to me at all, but that\\'s not the case anymore!  All three are strikingly beautiful. There\\'s no need to go into how great The Bee Gees\\' songs are on this album, it\\'s the early Bee Gees for pete\\'s sake.  Their vocal and songwriting greatness was already a given by the time of this album.     The mono versions of these albums have been such a treat on all of these reissues.  Unlike the mono version of an album such as The Beatles\\' \\\\\\\\\"Sgt. Pepper,\\\\\\\\\" there are no real differences between the mono and the stereo mix like a different guitar track or vocal here and there.  The difference lies within the perception of the ear that\\'s hearing it.  I\\'ve always found the mono versions to sound much more cohesive and more like a live performance of the material.  The mono version of \\\\\\\\\"Odessa\\\\\\\\\" seems to actually bring the entire album together better than the stereo version does.  It\\'s probably because mono mixes remain steady throughout while stereo mixes can rock you back and forth with each track.  I actually prefer to listen to the mono versions on headphones to get the full impact of the mix.  Highly recommended!    The \\\\\\\\\"Sketches For Odessa\\\\\\\\\" disc is great, with some of the demos actually rivaling the finished songs on the album.  Now how a song titled \\\\\\\\\"Barbara Came To Stay\\\\\\\\\" turns into a song about Thomas Edison I have no idea, but somehow it did.  Both the demo and early take of \\\\\\\\\"Melody Fair\\\\\\\\\" are equally strong in their melodic appeal.  The Part Two section of \\\\\\\\\"Whisper Whisper,\\\\\\\\\" cast in a waltz time, doesn\\'t work and it\\'s a good thing they decided to pump it up with some soul for the released version.  After all, it\\'s one of the best sections of the entire record.  The demo of \\\\\\\\\"Lamplight\\\\\\\\\" is especially intimate and charming, proving the song\\'s ability to tug at heartstrings without so much heavy echo and orchestration.  The early take that follows showcases the song on it\\'s way to becoming the finished product but isn\\'t nearly as charming as the demo.  The song is great being on one extreme side of the map or the other, but not in the middle.  The early take of \\\\\\\\\"Give Your Best\\\\\\\\\" sounds great just being a straightforward country tune without being dressed up in the novelty touches that the released version has.  The \\\\\\\\\"Seven Seas Symphony\\\\\\\\\" demo is very eloquent with Maurice\\'s piano playing.  The alternate version of \\\\\\\\\"Never Say Never Again\\\\\\\\\" ALMOST works, that is until the overbearing, distorted lead guitar overdub comes in and sinks the entire track like the ship Veronica itself!  The alternate \\\\\\\\\"First Of May\\\\\\\\\" features an even more heartbreaking lead vocal from Barry than the released version.  Closing out the disc are two previously unreleased tracks that could have been issued as an non-LP single, and why that wasn\\'t considered is weird to say the least!  Both \\\\\\\\\"Nobody\\'s Someone\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"Pity\\\\\\\\\" are so good it\\'d be hard to pick one for an A-side!  My bets would be on \\\\\\\\\"Pity\\\\\\\\\" simply because it\\'s more upbeat and catchy.    Onto the packaging, I love how the inner sleeves look for the CDs!  The stereo/mono versions are housed in a gatefold cardboard jacket that looks like it could have succeeded as the album\\'s original cover.  The \\\\\\\\\"Sketches For Odessa\\\\\\\\\" is in it\\'s own separate sleeve looking like it could have been it\\'s own album all together.  Heck, even the front picture on the inner booklet looks like it would\\'ve made a great cover!  BUT, a problem that plagued the original vinyl release plagues this CD reissue as well.  It seems that you just cannot have a flocked cover without little hairs getting all over the discs!  Fortunately with a CD, you don\\'t have to worry about the fine hairs being grounded into any grooves when you play it (the hairs on my vinyl records are etched into them for life).     If the mono version of this album hadn\\'t been included I would\\'ve rated it at four stars for being \\\\\\\\\"VERY GOOD.\\\\\\\\\"  The packaging alone warrants five but it\\'s the music contained within that always comes first.  \\\\\\\\\"Odessa\\\\\\\\\" is a great double album, a must for any Bee Gees fan, but still remains a tad bit overblown.  The album has always suffered, in my opinion, from lack of a better track sequencing.  Closing the album\\'s third side with TWO orchestral instrumentals is just absurd no matter how you look at it.  However, it works itself out much better presented in CD format (you can now pretend that \\\\\\\\\"With All Nations\\\\\\\\\" opens side four).

I had already taken in the Universal,Hammer and various other essentials made from the 20s to the 70s.    Like many a Horror fan,I went through my gore and brutal phase,and John Carpenter was one of my idols.  Having seen The Thing(1982),Halloween(1978) and Escape From New York(1981),I had highly anticipated The Fog(1980).  It was a wonderful Horror film,playing like a classic Ghost Story,that unfortunately many in my seemingly,close-minded generation passed on.    Ten years later,I went back to re-discover many of the films of my teen years,and discovered Carpenter\\'s The Fog in my DVD collection.    Far from a nostalgic remembrance,this film is a welcome relief from alot of the mindless and charcaterless gore films of that period and now.  Played as a Ghost Story in the style of Val Lewton,it also combined elements of Carpenter\\'s Halloween and the typical Hawksian touches such as snappy dialouge and strong characters.    The gore is minimal,as the film wisely relies on atmosphere and build(the credit sequence in the beginning is among the scariest in the film and keeps the audience defensive ALL the way through!).  Carpenter gathers a good cast in this one including Tom Atkins,Jamie Lee Curtis,Janet Leigh,Adrienne Barbeau and Hal Holbrook,who all add an era of believability to there roles.    It\\'s also a plus that the otherwordly denizens of the Fog are the work of Rob Bottin,who later creates the shape changing monstrosities on Carpenter\\'s The Thing.    The story is simple:A ship of gold carrying lepers are killed years ago,there gold stolen.  100 years later they return to the coastal town where they wrecked and begin to murder for revenge...and the return of there gold!    It\\'s handled surprisingly well.    The DVD is nice filled with two documentaries,a script to scene comparsion,awesome trailers(\\\\\\\\\"What in the HELL is in that fog?!\\\\\\\\\") and audio commentary withCarpenter and producer,Debra Hill.    I had picked this up for the cheap price of three bucks,but have to say it\\'s worth the price Amazon charges for it.    Very reccomended for the Horror fan who is more interested in atmosphere and suspense than just buckets of blood.    A good one.....don\\'t miss it!

The hypnotic, mechanized vocal samples on the erie, lo-fi tune haunted me while I impatiently waited for my ordered copy to arrive from Amazon.com.  I even found myself listening to the thirty second clip of \\\\\\\\\"Archangel\\\\\\\\\" from the online order page, over and over on repeat, until the day the record showed up.  What\\'s so captivating about Burial you ask?  Well, it\\'s  hard to pin down, but allow me to embellish the sound of Untrue for a sec.  The signature jittery high hat shimmers and rim shot patterns, create a consistent, mellow breakbeat rhythm that gently but hastily pulls the synthetic strings and  pitch altered vocals toward what feels like is going to be a build up, but turns out to be just more anticipation.  Meanwhile, a dark cloud of exaggerated vinyl hiss, and a swarm of random, crispy blips loom over the mix, while an unimaginable amount of reverb sucks the whole thing into an ambient abyss.  There are really no obvious climaxes at all, rather a constant payoff in the gradual acknowledgment that the anticipation is fraudulent.  Over filtered, melodic vocal samples come and go like specters searching for a living soul to connect with. Hopelessly mumbling love songs, they rarely succeed in doing more than emphasize the somber, emotional void before being smeared into the hazy obscurity.  As the cover art indicates, this record is meant to be listened to on headphones, preferably with the jacket hood up, during an engaged people watching session.  You won\\'t likely find this album on shelves around the city, so pick it up on online or at the very least purchase the \\\\\\\\\"Archangel\\\\\\\\\" mp3 from Amazon.com for ninety nine cents.

There appears to be a discrepancy in his version of events.  He claims that he dropped out of school before graduating.  Then for several years he was a laborer.  Let\\'s assume this is at least three years or else he wouldn\\'t have used the word \\\\\\\\\"several.\\\\\\\\\"  Then, he says he got a job on a tramp freighter and saw the world for eight years.  That makes eleven total years.  Afterwards, when he couldn\\'t find laboring jobs any longer, he went into sales.  Add another year to make twelve years.<br /><br />According to his timeline, within one year of starting in sales he was a top salesman and a year after was made a Vice President in charge of 95 people.  Adding two more years brings us to a (minimum) grand total of fourteen years.<br /><br />None of this seems unusual until Mr. Tracy triumphantly adds that at this point he was only 25 years old!<br /><br />Does he really expect us to believe that he dropped out of school at the tender age of 11?  Could this be an example of Mr. Tracy trying to make his early life sound a little tougher than it actually was?  In the same way that a rap star claims to have grown up in the projects to give him more \\\\\\\\\"street cred\\\\\\\\\" when he really grew up in a middle class suburb?<br /><br />While Mr. Tracy\\'s life story is strange, it doesn\\'t take anything away from the advice in his book, which I found to be quite useful.

This is normal if you\\'re used to a previous version of the game where there was no frame to keep all the hexes together (there was no sea frame, just sea hexes). So yes, it takes a bit of effort to push everything down but it will lay flat with just a bit of effort.    For new players: Please DO play your first game using the recommended map layout and starting positions in the rules. It can be tempting to jump right into a random map game where the map and setup is different every time you play - the trouble is, until you are familiar with the game, you won\\'t pick the best starting positions. And a bad starting position will put you behind for the rest of the game and you won\\'t have enough fun to motivate you to want to play the game again.

The story reads like an actual screenplay and it definitely feels like it comes off the pages.<br /><br />Our characters instantly make themselves favorites in the comic book world.  Alan Moore couldn\\'t have imagined better ideas.  He kind of makes fun of the superhero idea and slams our brains with the reality of it.  This realistic approach to superheroes totally gives comic readers a new perspective and that makes this novel extremely valuable.<br /><br />I won\\'t get too much into the politics because I wasn\\'t alive at the time.  I believe, however, that it gives the book a much bigger importance by tangling itself into the real world.

It is sci-fi fantasy with realistic proportions; it is suspenseful; it is about ethics and loyalty; it is about integrity; it has a romance that has boundaries; it presents the possibility of a healthy parental relationship; it promotes an environmental message without extremism. Most importantly, it helps young people redefine the qualities of beauty.<br /><br />The book begins in a futuristic society where Tally awaits her 16th birthday - a milestone when she will be ready to have the operation to make her a Pretty.  As a Pretty, she will enter the world of the Pretties - full of fun and happiness.  She meets another Ugly who tells her about a world outside the Utopian system and who tries to entice her to escape.  She wonders why anyone would want to avoid a world of happiness and the opportunity to be beautiful?  Their friendship results in a terrible choice for Tally. Which will bring more sorrowful consequences - to betray her friend or remain loyal and lose her personal hopes and dreams?  This young girl's choice unravels a dark secret and changes society as she knows it.<br /><br />Uglies is very well-written with characters that are gradually and skillfully developed.  The plot unveils at a consistent pace so that there is never a dull moment.<br /><br />One caveat - like Lays Potato Chips, you cannot have just one.  While sufficiently resolving the first novel, the author has built-in a device where you will be compelled to read the sequel.

Read it and read it again!', 'review_body': \"I haven't read a Jane Austen novel in years. The last time I read one of her novels I was very young and it was not by choice. If you want to rediscover Jane Austen, start with Emma. This novel is about a very snobby, spoiled, and at times malicious young lady by the name of Emma Woodhouse. Emma lives in the village of Highbury with her hypchondriac father. After Emma's Governess, who throughout the book is known as Mrs Weston marries, Emma is left with a lot of time on her hands. I'm afraid she does not use this time wisely.    Emma finds a new friend and protege in Harriet Smith, a young lady with an unknown past who Emma takes under her wing. Emma brings it upon herself to give young Harriet somewhat of a social makeover. She induces her to aspire to greatness and put on airs proper to a lady of Emma's class, although she's not even sure what class Harriet belongs to. When Harriet is offered marriage by a farmer by the name of Mr Martin, Emma is horrified! She convinces Harrriet that such a man is hardly worthy of her and intices her to find romance with the handsome but vain vicor, Mr Elton. Emma's disasterous matchmaking decison is the focus of the book.     I found this novel incredibly amusing!  Emma's unbashed snobbery, Harriet's ignorance, Mr Woodhouse's constant worry of illness befalling every character in the book. This book is literally laugh out loud funny at times. The novel features many other equally amusing characters. Mr Knightley, Emma's sister's brother-in-law, who is the one person in the novel to always tell Emma how it really is. The chatty and annoying Mrs Bates, the insufferable Augusta Elton who is almost as full of herself as Emma.     When Jane Austen wrote this book she claimed no one but herself would like Emma Woodhouse. Emma is conceited and selfish, but the beauty of this book is that Emma is forced to come to terms with what her behavior has caused her and those she loves. The Emma you meet at the beginning of the novel is not thesame Emma that you say goodbye to at the end.     If you want a simple description of what this novel is about I will tell you that it is about a young lady's road to maturity and growth. Jane Austen isn't for everyone, but if you are curious or want to give her novels another try, start with Emma. It's guaranteed to renew your interest in one of the greatest writers in English literature.

You can argue and say that `The Departed' made such an impact, beings that it did walk away with top honors, but seriously, no one was talking about `The Departed' like they were talking about `Little Miss Sunshine'.  It became a phenomenon.  The following year `Juno' waltzed up to an Oscar nomination thanks to the success this little yellow bus and even this years `Slumdog Millionaire' is being called the `Little Film that Could'.  `Little Miss Sunshine' represents that little independent film that garners cult status quickly and finds a place in the hearts of award bodies everywhere.<br /><br />Now I liked this movie, but personally it isn't deserving of the unabashed praise it received.  It's actually quite common and not very imaginative when you think about it.  It's sweet and charming but nothing new, and while it has it's moments of wit it also has awkward moments that you know are supposed to be funny, but just aren't.<br /><br />It's a mixed bag for me.<br /><br />The film follows the Hoover family (as dysfunctional as they come) as they embark on a cross country trip to get young Olive to a beauty pageant.  Richard, the father, is a self obsessed man who aspires to get famous off his step program to a better you.  His wife Sheryl is merely trying to hold together her family while remaining remotely sane.  Their oldest son Dwayne has taken a vow of silence while he waits to join the Air Force.  Richard's father Edwin is a foul mouthed gruff drug addict with a heart of gold and Sheryl's brother Frank is a suicidal teacher who is crumbling emotionally after a sour relationship with a male student.  Stuck in the middle is young impressionable Olive who just wants to be pretty.<br /><br />Everything that can go wrong does go wrong, but tagged onto the end of this comedy is a message of togetherness and family; a spark of sweet saccharine goodness that makes you feel a little better about yourself and your loved ones.  I understand why people like this film; even I liked it, but I find it hard to consider it the best of anything.<br /><br />Breslin is a natural talent; very genuine and believable.  One friend of mine said that he never caught her acting, which is very true.  I have always liked Kinnear and I found his turn here probably best in show.  He was superbly entertaining and understandable as the controlling father obsessed with winning.  Toni Collette continues shining her beacon of light on everything she touches; and I adore her for that.  There was a lot said about the supporting actor race that year and the three `Sunshine' men; Alan Arkin, Steve Carell and Paul Dano.  Honestly I fell that AMPA's got this one right, and I know that not many agree with me there.  I thought that Arkin was very genuine and heartwarming here, even at his crudest.  No, he should not have won, but that's beside the point.  Carell was also very warm here and understood his character (what a stretch for him) and Dano was interesting yet a little vapid.  I found his emotional breakdown rather hard to believe, but he does try really hard so I'll give him props for that.  He stepped up his game in a HUGE way the following year with a stellar performance in `There Will Be Blood'.<br /><br />Truth be told, the funniest parts in this movie involve running, and just the sight of any of the cast barreling down a street or a parking lot gives me the giggles.

I've listened to it a couple of times, and I think it's going to take a while to grow on me. There are some excellent, immediately accessible tracks, and the band is extended to include other musicians, notably Doyle Bramhall II, with whom DT played with Eric Clapton on tour last year, and who co-produces some of the tracks here. My first impression is that this album has a narrower musical spectrum than the superb Songlines, which is on almost permanent play in my car. However, each of the previous DTB albums have been rather different from one another, so I suppose fans should have expected this! This album is the first produced by DT himself, and recorded at his new studio at his home in Florida. I think that DT's innate humility has resulted in less prominence for his own playing and more emphasis on a group performance. It has a more bluesy feel than Songlines, with the world/roots influences definitely muted by comparison. However, my immediate feeling is that if I'd never heard Songlines, Already Free would be brilliant and worth 5 stars. So, I guess it's going to take a while to soak in, but I'm sure it will become a favourite in time - I find that albums with immediate payback pale after a while, but those you have to work at a bit are ultimately more rewarding.

Brilliant album all the way through.  The album starts off with the breaking glass rhythm flowing very nicely into 'The Runaway', which I'd only heard so far on the live GG album 'Playing the Fool'.  The studio version is fantastic.  'An Inmates Lullaby' is good, more subdued, where Derek Schulman sings in a strange falsetto. 'Way of Life' returns to an upbeat rocking tempo altho there will be tempo changes throughout the song, with some great keyboard work from Kerry Minear and great guitar from Gary Green. Very progressive sounding, I really loved this track.  'Experience' is another great track that, before this cd, I had only heard live. Kerry Minear handles the lead vocals with Derek handling the 'Master inner voices, making the choices' part.  It's *classic* Gentle Giant.  Next comes another Minear track 'A Reunion', a delightful medieval piece featuring some nice violin from Ray Schulman.  Minear's vocals in the studio are fantastic, but as I understand it, too weak for live performance where Derek usually takes that task.  However, Minear is the natural choice for all GG medieval style music.  The studio tracks conclude with the title piece 'In A Glass House'. Once again we hear some really nice violin to start and then Minear's progressive keyboard work.  There's even some saxophone in here from Derek.  This track could be considered a showcase of GG's multi-instrument viruousity.  The track fades out and ends with an audio collage of bits of the album.  Very nice.    With the Alucard release, you'll get two live bonus tracks; 'The Runaway/Experience' and 'In a Glass House'.  Both are worth the price of this album alone, but coupled with the brilliant studio tracks, make this an essential GG album.  5 stars.\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-23 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': '3k3z_H0BANdU85SxOb8F', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 25799069, 'review_id': 'R1U3H354R9WDWB', 'product_id': '0439023483', 'product_parent': 245449872, 'product_title': 'The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, Book 1)', 'product_category': 'Books', 'star_rating': 5, 'helpful_votes': 0, 'total_votes': 0, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'What I really hated about this book...', 'review_body': 'is that this book came out in fall of 2008 and I read it in January of 2009.

There are no princes waiting in the wings to save her. She is her own champion. Katniss lives in a world so desperate that love is stretched to the limit. What will you do for your sister? Will you starve for her, commit illegal crimes punishable by death for her, and even die for her? What will you do when a stranger saves your life with a simple gesture? Owe them forever? Save them in return at the cost of your own life?    With the livelihoods of her sister and mother resting on her shoulders Katniss\\'s situation seems to harsh for her to keep any bearing on humanity. What is the point of morality when you are watching your loved ones starve? Yet, even in the middle of the brutal Hunger Games in which her life and death struggle is merely an amusement for the wealthy she has a respect for human life surpassed by no one else. Unlike those with lots of food and comfort she does not have the luxury of caring about anyone but herself and yet she helps, saves, and grieves over the lives of everyone she meets. She\\'s not sickly sweet, innocent, or annoying. But she does everything she can to be honorable and kind just as she does everything she can to survive a senseless bloodbath in which she\\'s expected to kill anyone who crosses her path.    And I can\\'t wait to see how the Big Brother \\\\\\\\\"Panem\\\\\\\\\" is to be dealt with in the next two books. Katniss is not one to back down from a fight and it it\\'s obvious from the beginning that the eventual confrontation with \\\\\\\\\"Panem\\\\\\\\\" will be the biggest fight of her life.    Also I\\'d like to see just how the Peeta-Katniss-Gale love triangle turns out. Peeta (a kind, gentle, and even sweetly vulnerable baker\\'s son) and Gale (a resourceful, cautious, capable, strong coal miner\\'s son) seem to represent different sides of Katniss. Perhaps Katniss\\'s choice between the two is more relevant to the world of Suzanne Collin\\'s little post-apocalyptic book than what at first seems apparent.    I don\\'t think this book is to bloody for most kids. I think that one of the important points to take away from this book is that life is harsh, tough, desperate but that doesn\\'t mean we should give up or hide. Actually, I think a book like this might even be empowering for most kids. As a kid, I would have loved Katniss and would have wanted to be strong like her. Heck, I do now as a twenty something.

The Name of the Wind is a powerful read and Rothfuss is that rare gem of an author who has not only genuinely mastered the art of story-craft, he has utterly redefined the bar of excellence of an entire genre all within his first published novel.<br /><br />'Wind' chronicles the early adventures of our young protagonist, Kvothe.  In a few words or less, our hero encounters life's ups and downs as he pursues his goal to attend the University to become an archanist; a surprisingly simple and in hindsight, almost clique plotline for a 662 page hardcover book.  But herein lies the unparalleled talent of the author-- his brilliant storytelling.  Most remarkable is the haunting and beautiful description of music.  Rothfuss claims not to be a musician and I can hardly believe it.  I am a molded musician, and how a non-musician can capture that intimate and indescribable love with mere ink and paper is beyond me.  Wind's beautifully crafted prose and pacing sweeps like Beethoven or Rachmaninoff; we laugh out loud and sigh, sometimes cry inside, all the while reminding ourselves to breathe as the pages turn.<br /><br />Rothfuss has done a fine piece of work and there are but a few holes to poke at.  First is the above mentioned plot.  The plot was the &quot;weakest&quot; link in the entirety of `Wind' but herein lies the difficulty of confining arcing plot and broad character motives into a cut section of a story.  The Name of the Wind is the first portion of a continuous story never meant to be broken into a trilogy.  Most of this first book is character building and we get to know Kvothe in a way like you would a new friend over an autumn Sunday brunch.  To his credit, Rothfuss does a fine job of sectioning the story off in book one.  Near the end, we get a feeling of winding down, content with some victories and still hungry with some wants.<br /><br />Secondly, the numerous try-fail cycles regarding Kvothe and his love interest Denna became redundant, especially since each hopeful meeting ends pretty much the same way each time.  Denna is mysterious for no good reason and Kvothe's infatuation with her is not well motivated, though perhaps understandably so when it comes to the nature of attraction.  Near the end of the book, I'm rooting for Kvothe to rid himself of his obsession already and get along in finding his first real love who names him 'Dulator'.  Also superfluous is the large section regarding the draccus encounter near the end of the book.  Much time is dedicated to this rabbit trail of a side story which results in little more information gained of the antagonistic Chandrian, no souvenir of the rare draccus to take back to the University as show and tell, and another chance and convenient bump-in with the stunning Denna which ends in yet another dead end where the girl disappears and the boy must temper his raging hormones in disappointment.<br /><br />All in all, a most inspirational debut.  'Wind' is not just a one night stand.  With subsequent reads, slow down and appreciate the unique elegance of description, the lyricism and rhythm of the writing.  Each sentence is loved and carefully crafted, not a word is wasted or wanted, and our deepest emotions are touched with simplicity of words both said and unsaid.  Bravo for an arresting prologue bristling with questions and the reminiscently similar yet conclusive epilogue.  Hints and juicy bits of future plot are revealed in good proportion within Wind, not so much to leave too many unanswered questions, but making us near wild as we wait and clamor for the second book.  Readers be warned that Rothfuss is just warming up.  The back of the book blurb of Wise Man's Fear was recently released and it promises a sweeping scope of a story.  Combined with the expected quality of writing, readers are in for a treat.<br /><br />Name of the Wind is my highest recommended book of the year.  Considering this is only the debut novel, one can only imagine what will be rolling off the press in years to come as Rothfuss heads the pack of young, revolutionary authors that are pushing and redefining the limits of the Fantasy genre.  5 big shiny stars.f the year.

Rocky is still as palpable as it ever was because it\\'s one of those rare films that speaks directly to the heart--everyone pulls for the underdog. Almost all successful men and women were chosen from birth to be successful. These people are born to the right people and have the right pedigree. These people are born tall, or strong, or beautiful. These people may be born rich, or these people may be born into a stable middle class home. Even if they are born to a single parent, these individuals are born to a single parent who wants the best for them, a parent who\\'ll sacrifice everything to send them to the right schools, a parent who\\'ll scrub floors to send that kid to college. Some people are born and raised by both their parents and their grandparents. Look at Obama. Could he have overcome his racial heritage and his economic disadvantages without the love, guidance, determination, and support of his mother?--I don\\'t think so.<br /><br />Then, there are those of us who aren\\'t so lucky. We\\'re born dirt poor. No one loves us. We aren\\'t tall, strong, smart, or beautiful. We\\'re doomed in the womb. We watch as others leave the neighborhood for colleges. We watch our neighborhoods change around us. A building\\'s torn down; a new building goes up. We carry our dreams in our pockets with the few pennies we are able to earn with our High School diplomas; worse still, we\\'re dropouts and can\\'t find anything at all. We fade like afterthoughts. We become neighborhood faces,like that old busted chair or knicked-up table that never moves no matter what. You could paint the room, change the pictures, change the carpet, or change the sofa, but that old busted chair or knicked up table remains a constant fixture. You say to yourself, \\\\\\\\\"if only someone, somewhere, gave me a break,\\\\\\\\\" but all you get is scorn, rejection, and ridicule. There\\'s no excuse for any grown man or woman to fail, they say. Go to work, they say. Why aren\\'t you like such and such, they say. You should be doing this, they say. You should be doing that, they say. You look in the mirror and you see the deepening lines in your face; you look sad--you look away from your reflection. You crawl inside of yourself. You drink,you smoke--you don\\'t care anymore. You\\'re no good to a woman; you\\'re no good to yourself. You\\'re not a man anymore. You resign yourself to your fate: you\\'re a loser. You\\'ll live, you\\'ll die, and that\\'ll be that. So, you go and throw your last pennies and your dreams into a fountain and you make a wish. Then, out of the blue, opportunity takes you by surprise. At first it seems too good to be true. You\\'re afraid that, at any moment, you\\'ll wake up from a cruel shimmering dream. Then, you realize that you are not dreaming, that chance is smiling in your direction.You cry. You thought she\\'d forgotten you, but she didn\\'t. Chance comes early for some and late for others and when she leaves she\\'s gone forever. So you take your chance, and you make the most of it--you turn your life around and the people cheer you on. You\\'re born again.<br /><br />To me, this is the essence of Rocky, and no actor could have pulled it off like Sylvester Stallone. If you\\'ve ever been down or counted out, his realistic and raw portrayal of a down-and-out loan-shark collector will resonate with you. Bill Conti composed the soundtrack to this film. When Rocky\\'s sprinting across the wharf to \\\\\\\\\"Gonna fly Now\\\\\\\\\" you want to stand up and cheer him on. My favorite point in the movie is when Rocky goes down in the fourteenth round. Everbody--his trainer(BurgessMeredith)and his cornermen--are screaming and telling him to stay down and take the count-out. But Rocky\\'s been down forever and this time he\\'s fighting for the only chance he\\'s ever had in his whole miserable life. Then, Adrian (Talia Shire) is standing in the back of the arena watching Rock; she\\'s crying. She closes her eyes and says a prayer. Bill Conti\\'s \\\\\\\\\"Going the Distance\\\\\\\\\" is soaring as Rocky makes it to his feet. He\\'s bloody and swollen--he can barely see out of his right eye--but he shakes his head and tells the ref that he\\'s ok. Then, with the champ bearing down on him, Rocky sees his opportunity. The champ\\'s hands are high, his bruised right ribs are exposed. Rocky surges up with everything he has and smashes a left uppercut into the champ\\'s ribs. The bell rings, and Rocky survives the round. I don\\'t know if the film would have been as effective without Bill Conti\\'s soundtrack; the soundtrack gave a voice to every scene in the film. Scorceses\\'s Taxi Driver came out the same year as Rocky and many critics and fans feel that Taxi Driver should have won the Oscar instead of Rocky. If you go on the technical merits of both films, Taxi Driver is a superior film to Rocky; however, Taxi Driver does not stir the collective imagination as powerfully as Rocky does. Rocky is both universal and primal: almost everyone\\'s been down at some point in their lives, and almost everyone has a heart--in these respects, Rocky is superior to Taxi Driver. I\\'ve seen thousands of great films, from Hitchcock to Bergman, Kurosawa to fellini, Lang to Lean, Kazan to Copolla; Rocky remains my all-time favorite film.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001PKUVW6 Bondage and Discipline, Sadism and Masochism: Zack\\'s Odyssey Part 1]]men--are screaming and telling him to stay down and take the count-out.

David Cook worked hard on all of this beautiful work and richly deserves every bit of praise he is getting - and will get - as more and more people become aware of each and every one of these brilliant collaborations. I knew Permanent was an ode to AC, but I didn't anticipate weeping immediately upon hearing the brief preview of this song. Anyone who has had a loved one ill with cancer can relate to the beautiful words and music. Every song on this album is outstanding. And just as David broke records previously on the billboard charts - I suspect this outstanding album will likewise soar to the top up the charts. Outstanding work.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL COMMENTS<br /><br />The more I listen to this CD - the more incredible it is. Call me crazy - but I could wait for the physical CD to be delivered so I ordered from iTunes - and commented accordingly based on the above brief previous review. Needless to say the music is outstanding - I have incredible taste - and that includes my love for David Cook's music. There was no doubt in my mind this album was going to rise to the top and deliver. And - of course - it goes far beyond our expectations - even for those of use who knew it would be great!<br /><br />PERMANENT<br /><br /> I can't STOP listening to this song. It is one of the best songs I have listened to in my lifetime. It has a haunting melody - and beautiful - yet gut-wrenching lyrics that make me want to listen to it over and over and over again. It is just as relative to someone going through a divorce - or any illness or difficult experience. I find it mesmerizing. It would be easy to hear any number of professional artists covering this song - from Bette Midler to Bruce Springsteen. Also - I really expect to hear it one day in a movie -- unless it is too personal for David to lend permission.<br /><br />DAVID COOK<br /><br />David Cook is a true artist and rock professional. There is no doubt - with his magnificently blessed voice and enormously charismatic persona that he will be a talent to be reckoned with more years and years and years to come. His voice is mind-blowing. His music is outstanding. His personal presence and charisma is incredibly vulnerable and sweet yet he exudes sexy beyond my comprehension.

I suppose that was how Hollywood sold its stars back then. The last critique about the movie I have was that the ending was totally watered down and was not the much anticipated ending I thought would be offered since I felt it very symbolic to the whole moral of the story anyway. Other than that, I think the movie is worth it.<br /><br />...and you shouldn\\'t worry about hidden socialist or communist messages in the movie. I had read a professional review about the movie from another web source and the reviewer had mentioned that the movie made more of a political statement than the book. What? The only resemblance to any socialistic or communistic ideas I encountered were in the book and that (socialist) was how the authorities treated/policed the migrants and (communist) how Tom tells someone \\\\\\\\\"Damn right, I\\'m Bolshevisky!\\\\\\\\\" referring to Bolshevik and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and how the migrants were left with no other choice but to form their own communities if you will. So, for me, I just ignored those pretenses and enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />I hope you will too.lls someone \\\\\\\\\"Damn right, I\\'m Bolshevisky!\\\\\\\\\" referring to Bolshevik and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and how the migrants were left with no other choice but to form their own communities if you will.

There are more memorable lines of dialogue in this film that speak of the truths of life than in some entire years\\' worth of Oscar fare.  \\\\\\\\\"You do a thing and that\\'s what you are\\\\\\\\\".  Simple. Concise. Easy to understand. Irrefutably true. We are each nothing more than the sum of the things we have said and done.  This is the meaning of life and it\\'s in one throwaway line from a film filled with nearly two hours of genius.  The setting of New York is so quintessentially American that this film would not have worked anywhere else.  There is just something so instantly recognizable and identifiable about that city that every man, woman, and child in America feels like they\\'ve lived there even if (like me) they have never even been there.  There simply is no other possible place for Travis Bickle to dwell and it is used to full effect in this film.  Also of note is i9n the movie Cybill Shepherd\\'s hotness.  Her character\\'s overreaction to porn speaks of serious issues, but I suppose when you\\'re that gorgeous you can afford to be prudish.<br /><br />What most people remember from \\\\\\\\\"Taxi Driver\\\\\\\\\" is the legendary bit where DeNiro stands in front of a mirror and practices taunting an imaginary foe with the iconic line and mannerism that will never die, \\\\\\\\\"You talkin\\' to me?\\\\\\\\\".  Influences of the film that I didn\\'t mention in the video include numerous other musical references and homages in film and television.  In an episode of the second season of the cult television series [[ASIN:B0019BI11O Code Monkeys]] (only first season on DVD so far) there was an episode called \\\\\\\\\"My Pal Jodie\\\\\\\\\" which mocked the controversy surrounding violent video game slike [[ASIN:B000FRU1UM Grand Theft Auto]] by featuring a video game where you play as a man trying to kill a world leader known as \\\\\\\\\"Ray-Gun\\\\\\\\\" to win Jodie Foster\\'s love.  So 35 years later, \\\\\\\\\"Taxi Driver\\\\\\\\\" continues to inspire commentary on current events.  If that is not a deep work of art, nothing is.<br /><br />This is a movie that will speak to anybody who\\'s found society to be nearly irredeemable, but is still compelled to seek a connection to the people within it.  Go get yourself \\\\\\\\\"organizized\\\\\\\\\", understand all that is you, and take it to the world at large in the way you see fit.  This character\\'s plan of action is contrary to my very nature and downright psychotic, but as a fictional person in a work of art, his rampage is inspiring in it\\'s purity.  Bickle\\'s missions of choice are very different, but the same in that he seemed to seek to free the two women in his life from the thrall of two very different but in their own way powerful men. Travis may not have accomplished all of his goals in the movie or even consciously known what they were, but in his violent unfocused catharsis he does save the soul of young prostitute even as he abandons his own.  And even doing so in brutal fashion, he at least gains the respect of a woman he loves but will never understand.  Leave it to the media to turn a bloodbath into an act of heroism.<br /><br />The special features on this DVD include two commentaries, some great featurettes with Scorsese talking about his personal experiences, point of view, and goals when he made the film, and plenty more to delve into.

His language may at times seem a bit archaic, but I don't think we suffer from hearing people talk properly. The actors he works with adore him and the freedom he offers them.

Pullman is an artful storyteller, and this series is more than sufficient evidence. The plot is epic, enthralling, and will keep you glued to your seat for hours. And its themes are though provoking and challenging.    That said, I cannot recommend this series for everyone. Some will find its take on the secular-religious struggle unsettling or outrageous (read any one-star review from your neighborhood conservative Christian). And I do find the subtle thematic progression to be a distasteful choice: the fantastic plot in the first book lures young readers not yet able to analyze the the series' themes in terms of symbols, metaphor, or abstaction as they become more overt later on in the series.    While it has been called the antithesis to C.S. Lewis' Narnia series (which, by the way, also ought not be read by children until they reach an age where they're ready to interpret the symbolism and hold a few abstract discussions on religion), Pullman comes off not so much as atheist as humanist, condemning organized religion not spiritually, but on a utilitarian scale that weighs heavily against its potential for corruption, social ill, and ability to inflict guilt disproportionate to the fault, and lightly on its potential to work moral good.    If you can handle a mature discussion of the aforementioned topics, I highly recommend this series, and might even suggest a comparative reading of Pullman against Lewis.  Worth a read for the narrative alone if you don't find the themes distasteful, and definitely a strong pick to read for discussion.\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-23 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'KE3z_H0BANdU85SxOcAF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 48036726, 'review_id': 'RLOSH978PRL1C', 'product_id': 'B001F0VHEM', 'product_parent': 254998502, 'product_title': 'Funhouse Pink', 'product_category': 'Music', 'star_rating': 4, 'helpful_votes': 2, 'total_votes': 3, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': True, 'review_headline': 'Marital angst and some fun too boot !', 'review_body': 'Ok, first of all this entire cd is dedicated to her working out her pain, sorrow, anger and fear of her ending marriage.

It seemed that every few pages I was being told to buy this book, or buy all of some other guys books. There is a two page section that is taken from Guy Kawasaki\\'s blog. The whole thing is incredibly derivative (but shallow).    Finally, and this I can take responsibility for, it didn\\'t meet my needs because I am not Al Gore, nor am I the CEO of a company. If I gave a presentation in the style of this book I\\'d be laughed out of the office. I\\'m an analyst, and the warm and fuzzy slides would not be good. Duarte\\'s advice on data intensive slides? \\\\\\\\\"Both [of Stephen Few\\'s] books should be on your shelf along with everything Edward Tufte has written.\\\\\\\\\"  I have two Tufte books and they are virtually identical, I don\\'t see myself buying his others (and they suffer from the same lack of relevance to corporate analysts).

However, the book taught me a lesson that the thickness of the book has nothing to do with the ease and the speed of reading, and that \\\\\\\\\"popularity\\\\\\\\\" has nothing to do with \\\\\\\\\"good content\\\\\\\\\"....  The book was so boring and was so tedious in all those \\\\\\\\\"outliner\\\\\\\\\" stories that it made me fall asleep constantly. I knew it was going to be a lousy book after I read the introduction, cause it was so boring and tedious and the introduction sounded pretty irrelevant to \\\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\\\" which is the topic of the book....The author was forcing a link of relevancy by saying at the end of the introduction.... \\\\\\\\\"The value of the world you inhabit and the people you surround yourself with make you the person you are....\\\\\\\\\" something like that.... So all of a sudden, I got this after I read all the boring mumbles about the health issue in a small town up in Pennsylvania, and then the book began its first chapter about \\\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\\\", only it didn\\'t get any better, cause I found myself reading another boring mumbling chapter about some Canadian Hocky Team and its  scoring history and the long tedious tables of birthdays and names and hit/miss (whatever the game calls it) records of the teammates....Again, what was the point of this book? Teaching me how to appreciate Hocky?  Chapter after chapter, there are more boring long stories that the author forcibly made them connect to  the book\\'s topic on \\\\\\\\\"how people become successful\\\\\\\\\". I totally felt like a loser just by buying this book and even felt  more like a loser by reading it. I should have tossed it away and not cared so much about the money I paid for it.  \\\\\\\\\"Money can\\'t buy time\\\\\\\\\".  My dad told me over and over when I was a kid, and obviously, I hadn\\'t learnt.  So forget about the book, some of the things we need to become successful are, \\\\\\\\\"not to follow the crowd\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\"value our time\\\\\\\\\" , \\\\\\\\\"be able to cut our losses before more loss or damage is incurred\\\\\\\\\" , \\\\\\\\\"always learn our lessons and remember them\\\\\\\\\".  Guess this book did teach me something afterall....<br /><br />Feel like this book is a ripped off... It can be summarized into the following:  Combinations of factors that contribute to success are complicated and diversed... can be luck, can be your family, can be your school, can be just your birth place or your birthdays... etc etc.... (so does that mean the author himself doesn\\'t quite know what the exact formula to becoming successful is? So he wrote a book just to explain why he doesn\\'t know and nobody can possibly know the exact factors that make people successful??? Cause they can be uncontrollable, or predetermined... or whatever...), but according to the author, you can still make it thru hardwork and perseverance.... Doesn\\'t this sound familiar?  So all the tedious mumble jumble outliner stories that torture me many evenings all boiled down to this.  Now if you want to be successful, don\\'t be like me, stay away from this book, go watch a movie, try out a new restaurant, arrange a date with your spouse or someone you like.... go to a concert... but never stay home and read this book like I did.lessons and remember them\\\\\\\\\".

Some knock it totally saying it is in no way a horror movie.  Others see it for what it is.  It has never been called a horror film .  It has a presence of horror in a different way and is a true story that is more a courtroom drama that explores how the legal system deals with the case of a girl who died after an exorcism and while under the direct care of a priest.  Was she epileptic and psychotic?  Or was she possessed.  Medical facts verses spiritual facts.<br /><br />THE EXORCIST was a story that had the exorcism and gore galore in the forefront with the story of its characters in the background.  THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is about an exorcism with the strong story in the forefront.  This is a 5 star film.  We have three of the best actors of this decade - Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson and Scott Campbell.  These are hardcore actors and each tackles their role with strong intensity.<br /><br />Now before I continue I want to comment on how the film appears in blu ray.  It is absolutely astounding.  The 1080p high def picture is crystal clear and the truehd audio will blow you away.  This must be viewed with a 5.1 theater system.  I have seen this film many times and the clarity in blu ray makes the courtroom scenes seem as if I am watching a play and the actors are in my room.  The film does manage to expertly show the progression of Emily Rose's deterioration and if you view it with blu ray and a theater system the sound will have you on the edge of your seat and jumping out of your skin.  (Important note, if you watch DEXTER, it is great fun to see Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose.  She is superb.)<br /><br />Blu ray allows the viewer to see the emotions of the actos much more clearly.  Laura Linney is the attorney defending the priest accused of Emily's death and she is at first a self professed agnostic.  But the film is largely about how the whole affair affects her.  At the end she is very troubled and doesn't know what she is.  But her life is totally changed.  Even with all the great acting the film in my opinion belongs to Laura Linney and Jennifer Carpenter.<br /><br />If you want a standard B horror film with blood and gore this film is not for you.  This film is an insightful, intelligent courtroom drama about a very unique case and it is scary, suspenseful, troubling and dramatic but for different reasons.

I had heard info from Dr. Ornish and McDougall in programs and articles, and I knew Oprah had been sued for saying she was cutting out beef, but that was about it. Even if correct, I thought The China Study might seem like someone selectively choosing data to suit an agenda. In fact, I think Campbell ended up finding the opposite of what he started out expecting.<br /><br />Reading the book and checking the 35 pages of small print of reputable sources, I was amazed at how much research over so many years has shown that changing diet can slow and even reverse disease. That even if you are exposed to carcinogens or have a genetic predisposition, you can still affect your outcome with diet. It makes sense to me - seeing that Americans have such a high incidence of diseases that we almost consider inevitable, and yet some other parts of the world have much lower statistics for the same problems. And also knowing that migrants end up taking on the risks of the diets found in the countries to which they move.<br /><br />It's a good thing that diet can help reverse disease, because I'm guessing most people won't think seriously about their eating habits  until they get some bad news. When my father was diagnosed with cancer, suddenly we became avid readers of information about every kind of treatment and about diet. And diet is one of the easiest things for us to take control of at a time when things feel completely out of control. I hope this book helps more people slow the progress, and even prevent the onset, of diseases like cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. I also hope school lunches will someday at least include more whole plant foods like brown rice and leafy vegetables to help the next generation.<br /><br />If there was one thing I'd change it would be the title of the book.

It has contributed to the nonsense that there was a conspiracy - it is convincing when it presents the 'facts' but this film is full of errors. Also, as an artistic film, the strength of the story / emotional drama etc... is carried by the gravity of the evidence / material but one you realize this is all a fake and a Hollywood bastardization of the truth it falls apart factually and artistically.    This film has more holes than a wicker canoe. True, some of the evidence was 'gospel' when the film was made but many errors and half truths made it into the film as absolute fact. Some examples:  -Oswald was a lousy shot: in truth he was an expert shot and a sharpshooter - they even have his shooting tests from the military  -3 shots in 6 seconds - it wasn't. It was 8.3 seconds, and it's easy (time-wise)  -the head back and to the left - the wound evidence that Cyril Wecht has made a career out of criticizing is conclusive that he was shot from the rear. Conservation of momentum shows that if a huge heavy chunk of head moves away at high speed that the body will move in the opposite direction - in fact ANY direction is possible depending on the entry and where the fragments blow out  -the magic spinning bullet - anyone with 2 eyes who has really looked at the Zapruder film can see that when that shot was fired that Connelly was sitting lower than JFK, towards the middle of the car, and sharply turned - not sitting square and facing forward as shown in the film - when you connect the lines it make a perfect straight line  -the pristine bullet - it was not pristine, the groove pattern matched the rifle, PROVING it was fired by the rifle found in the book depository and there are missing fragments that were found in Connolly.  -I don't remember if it was in the film, but the microphone evidence has all been disproved    Also, Garrison's testimony in the real case relied ona  witness who admitted he never saw Clay Shaw, Ferry and Oswald together - when asked under a polygraph yes or no, he said 'well if you ask me yes or no, it would have to be a no'    Garrison suborned perjury in this case - that seems clearer and clearer over time. We don't want to accept that this dysfunctional insignificant human being who even the soviets got bored of (and realized he was useless as a piece of propaganda and sent him back) could possibly have cut down such a great historical figure. We don't WANT to believe that, but it is true. Garrison makes him out to be a hero double agent! For God's sake, this guy was a personality disorder whose only double agent work was trying to act tough and be a commie wanna-be who would annoy anti-Castro Cubans then later appear on TV to advocate Marxism. He was an attention hound ! The 60s weren;t today - not everybody got on TV looking for 15 minutes of fame like today - you had to try hard... He would constantly mix himself up with these people to stir the pot like all dysfunctional personality disorders who live off the reaction they create in others. That's why everyone think he's tied up in some conspiracy - because of the company he kept, his changing positions etc...but in reality he was playing people for reactions. It's pathetic, really.    So save your money and watch any of the excellent documentaries that tear this apart entirely. And don't (like me) waste any money on 'The Men WHo Killed Kennedy' documentary from the UK either - more pseudo-science with a deep british narrator's voice which is also full of errors and omissions and even wilder theories than in 'JFK'    People like pathologist Wecht have done a huge disservice further stirring this pot. Sure the gov't has screwed up aspects of the investigation and autopsy etc.. Show me anything they get right!    It's time to stop this nonsense once and for all - don't waste your money on the upteenth reissue of this dog of a film and make Stone ever richer than healready is. Look for a book or documentary that tells you the real story.     So, yawn, this is all phony Hollywood melodrama.

After all, it does not follow that simply because one employs a particularly beloved signifier in a title, that the object signified by said title accrues some metaphysical value, which is not credited to texts bereft of such clever strategies. Indeed, one must be quite bold to actually invoke \\\\\\\\\"Kafka\\\\\\\\\" before many who will examine and possibly read it has any other experience of one\\'s work. As it turns out, Murakami is absolutely justified in his appropriation of Kafka\\'s name in title of this wondrous work of imaginative brilliance.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the very real and significant contributions Freud made to our understanding to the workings of the mind, I maintain that his true claim to fame is as the greatest mythologist of the 20th century, especially in his later writings, and most especially in his books dealing with the socio-political foundations of society--The Future of an Illusion & Totem and Taboo come to mind--and commentary on such relations, which are found throughout his work. In order to walk away from these amazing books having gained anything of value, one has to be willing to give Freud a certain amount of artistic license and suspend disbelief. Having done so, the payoff is immense. For example, I found  that The Future of an Illusion is a perfect way to off-set Aristotle, J. S. Mill, and old Manny Kant, in that it offers a such a radically different account of the foundations of and motivation to morality that students must rethink all of the theories from beginning to end. (I don\\'t use Nietzsche\\'s On the Genealogy of Morals for reasons of temporal economy.)<br /><br />A similar act of faith is the very condition of the possibility of reading much more than 15 pages of this work of shockingly expansive imagination. As something of a fetishist for magical realism, I am more than prepared to have characters give birth to cats, dance with the devil, and defy the never questioned convention that holds that nature is ruled by certain unbreakable laws, such as gravity, when, in fact, the strongest claim that we can make as to the continuation gravity\\'s felicitous effects is that they have not failed to obtain to this point in human history, as far as we know. I must say, however, that neither de Bernieres (I am thinking not of Corelli\\'s Mandolin, but of his early trilogy, which elaborates the history of the fantastic village of Cochadebajo, which is in the same metaphysical neighborhood as the village to which Kafka Tamura, the title character as you will have guessed, travels in seeking to achieve what Nietzsche calls the most difficult task: becoming what one is.)nor Borges, Bulgakov (The Master and Margarita) nor Allende, not even Garcia Marquez,the Master himself, prepared me in the least for what lay ahead in Kafka on the Shore.<br /><br />Frankly, Murakami is in a league all his own. He requires not simply that we suspend disbelief, but that, in addition, we suspend all belief as well. In order to fully enjoy such an adventure as he has created in Kafka on the Shore, it is necessary that we do everything we can to approach the text with a tabula rosa. The less we know--or, shall I say ironic as this combination of words may appear, the less we believe ourselves to know, the more receptive we will be to the actuality of the work of art that is in front of us.<br /><br />There are plenty of talented, even brilliant writers. There are even quite a few whose talents reach far beyond a technical competence for putting a story together in a coherent and compelling fashion, but I have never encountered a writer with the temerity of Murakami. Kafka on the Shore would be just as easily at home in a class introducing metaphysics, specifically regarding time and identity, as in a survey of postmodern or contemporary fiction. Indeed, I would have hesitated not to give it a double classification Literature/Philosophy were I a publisher more interested in veracity than in the philosophy of money.<br /><br />One could easily write a book on Murakami\\'s theory of time, the profound elaborations of which I have not seen the likes of since Faulkner\\'s Oh, Jerusalem I Forget Thee, or Wild Palms. Likewise, there is an entire physics of identity, which lay at the heart of the book. One, moreover, which is rather Freudian, to say the least. For as it turns out, Kafka seeks nothing more than to avoid his father\\'s curse that he will be murdered by Kafka, who will then sleep with this mother and his sister: Aeschylus by the Shore just does not have the right ring to it.<br /><br />Starting off from this premise--of which the reader remains ignorant well into the text--Kafka, who is 15, runs away from home and by virtue of a force no more under the power of his will than pure contingency, he ends up in Takamatsu. As serendipity would have it, this is the very same town to which Mr. Nakata, who has murdered Kafka\\'s father--ignoring the fact that he somehow deposits bloody evidence some distance away from the scene of the crime, where Kafka happens to have blacked out--also eventually travels. Mr. Nakata is  one of the more interesting characters in literary history. He is not very smart, not being able to read or write, but he has the singular ability to converse with cats. That is, until he encounters Johnny Walker; whether Mr. Walker is red, black, or blue we have no indication. Suffice it to say that Colonel Sanders is dealing in something more than 12 original herbs and spices these days; though the women for whom he serves as pimp are spicier than anything one may find on one\\'s fried hen, if the example we are introduced to is any indication. Yet, he remains a friend to the community and not simply a trafficker in sex, for without him neither Kafka, Mr. Nakata, nor any number of secondary characters would be able to fulfill their destinies.<br /><br />So, are you following me? No? Good, then you have some idea, however penurious and nebulous, of what it  is like to take a trip to the shore in the mind of Haruki Marakami. Hell, Kafka reads like Kant when placed beside this fantastic phantasmagoric writer the internal logic of whose book is unimpeachable. And this is perhaps the most stunning feat of all the various and sundry Enquirer like activiities that occur in the novel; this most impossible narrative turns out to have been obeying the laws of (dia)logical formations from the very beginning. Though it takes far longer to comprehend this than it does in your average everyday ontologically unstable narrative, the events of the story have unfolded according to a certain necessity, which was laid out from the very first pages: absolutely stunning!<br /><br />In short, I recommend this intellectual adventure to everyone who thinks it exciting to think differently than one did the day before, and is willing to continue to have one\\'s thinking evolve to the point of devolution. Fortunately, and perhaps this is the true gift that Murakami possesses, the author takes us time and time to the edge of reason and sense, only to pull us back just when we have been convinced that it may be  best, if we were to go ahead and plunge body and mind into the abyss. Indeed, for those whose intellectual promiscuity is somewhat more reckless than the average homo sapien, it would be difficult not to feel let down at having been teased with the possibility of a beautifully transgressive literary experience, were it not for the fact that the next available opportunity for trying on a novel identity is found on the very next page or sooner. I do, however, have one rather serious warning; Kafka on the Shore is not for herd animals or for anyone who believes that syllogistic logic is the be all and end all of human intellectual achievemenet, which really amount to the same thing, when one thinks about it. Long live narrative and ontological uncertainty! Long live Haruki Murakami!ver penurious and nebulous, of what it  is like to take a trip to the shore in the mind of Haruki Marakami.

And it is as breathtaking as the play.<br /><br />The premise circles around doubts the three main character had among each other and the doubt on what is faith, love and care. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is an old school nun who believes in old values and old ways of life. New inventions, including ball point pens are making people losing their disciplines in life by finding an easy way out. In come Sister James (Amy Adams) who displays a committing passion for teaching the new generation. She is young and has strong compassion for her students. On the other side is the unconventional priests loved by the congregation who uses ball point pens (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and believes that the church must move on with the congregation to retain their faith in the church.<br /><br />No doubt these characters clashed with each other - all out of good intend - but then became a tug-of-war that brought the peaceful parish into intellectual intrigues. Who knew the Bible better could no longer be proved to be a sure winner and everyone needed to pull out all the tricks they have under their sleeves.<br /><br />Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman proved that their Oscars in the past are well deserved. The subtleties, the mind games and their confrontations are so gripping that you just couldn\\'t take your eyes off the screen. It has been quite some time that a confrontation done only through dialogues and out-witting without any physical actions have been so breath taking and rings in your head even after you left the theatre. This is great theatre brought on to the silver screen. And these two Oscar winners just did the transition perfectly. Amy Adams tried very hard but she is up again two legends, so she is on very disadvantageous grounds. But she managed to pull out a fair game to show that she is more than a happy chanting princess in \\\\\\\\\"Enchanted\\\\\\\\\". Another memorable scene is the confrontation between the student\\'s mother (played by Viola Davis) and Sister Aloysius. The dynamics of trusting and doubting and the revelation of new information that tips the balance of power to and fro was just spectacular.

Almost throughout, the orchestra is \\'acoustically edited\\' via microphone placement and (re)mixing to emphasize what Karajan views as the important parts of the sound, while diminishing all the other \\\\\\\\\"stuff\\\\\\\\\". A simple case in point (as there are 38 CDs!), is the last movement of the Chaikovsky Third Symphony where the strings are almost not present -- at all. The first time listener would miss 40% (or so) of this movement; it\\'s simply all brass (and quite close mic\\'ed as well).    Bruckner Seven and Nine as two more examples reflect the same \\\\\\\\\"my vision\\\\\\\\\" attitude. Forty years (or so) later, I have become accustomed to basic excellent performance; the playing on many of the \\\\\\\\\"lesser\\\\\\\\\" works (eg lower number Bruckner, and Chaikovsky) is often \\'radio orchestra\\' quality.    The Beethoven cycle, excellent in many ways is for me caught up in the personality of Karajan. I think of how Furtwangler brings out the epic and drama without always saying \\\\\\\\\"look at me\\\\\\\\\".

That album is Pink Moon. That damn thing haunts me and I think about it at random times and feel an urge to listen to it immediately. A Love Supreme is the only other album that does that to me.<br /><br />Five Leaves Left however would come next. For me it doesn't live up to the hype and I don't particularly love it. There isn't a single bad or weak track here, they are all great in fact. Drakes lyrics are easily the most personal and best written here as against the other two albums. His guitar playing is a virtuosic as always, but something about this album just doesn't feel right. Maybe because Pink Moon was my introduction into Drake's music it will always be the standard for me to which I compare the rest of his work. It may sound quite jaded but it isn't anything I can help.<br /><br />Only three songs on Five Leaves Left really hit me as classics and as brilliant. 'River Man' being the first. The somber tone in Drakes voice accompanied by the slightly out of place string arrangement is the sort of thing John Lennon and Paul McCartney tried to do with 'A Day In The Life' but didn't quite pull of. The second being 'Three Hours.' This to me might be the greatest song Drake ever wrote next to 'Pink Moon.' In at a staggering six minutes in length, which is like the equivalent of 'Mountain Jam' for the Allman Bros. it is truly a mini-epic. Lyrically it is unparalleled by anything else. The mood is dark as usually but I can't help but feel hope in the songs melody. The chugging bass line accompanied by almost renaissance guitar give an uplifting feel. The song is pure genius. The third being the lyrical genius of 'Fruit Tree' in which on his debut album Drake confesses that he knows his music won't reach the acclaim and recognition it should until his life has ended. Poetic bliss.<br /><br />As for the rest of Five Leaves Left nothing stands out, nothing strikes me as blaam! Though nothing else is bad. It just simply plays, and plays well. For a debut album, Five Leaves Left is incredible, but it still showed that Drake had more ground left to cover.s life has ended. Poetic bliss.

Coming along in a time of music when damn near every album was difficult this manages to be even more so. Adding to the fact is that no other album by Drake is this busy. But more so than that, I don't know if I actually like this record. I have listened to it over and over again but I don't think I even like it in the slightest bit. Much in the same way that I think Sleep Dirt by Frank Zappa is a fantastic record but cannot stand to listen to the damn thing. Bryter Layter suffers equally. I think this is a nice, or at best decent record despite the fact that I often find it impossible to listen to it.<br /><br />For me many of the songs here are forgettable and stand out very little in my mind if at all. 'Hazy Jane II' stands out the most in my mind but mostly because I hate the song. I truthfully find the whole whoa-is-me folky-jazz number incredibly pretentious and trite. Though I can respect and fully understand why so many consider it a full blown classic and the star of Bethlehem on this record. 'Introduction' stands out to me because it is the part of the album I love the most. Drake's fantastic finger picking of acoustic guitar has been one of the things I love about him most. His knowledge of alternate tunings and wide range and reach make for one underrated player. 'At The Chime Of A City Clock' is the only other standout for me. The subtle drumming mixed with the bright strings remind me of Central Park in the winter. The song is beautiful.<br /><br />As for the rest of the album I couldn't even begin to describe another song with out hearing it because they all seem so blaa to me. What doesn't help this album for me is that the fantastic guitar playing of Thompson is really out of place on a Drake record, and Drake's own guitar playing is ofter lost in the production which also on this album is some of the worst I have ever heard.<br /><br />But what really bothers me about this record is that it is without a doubt Drake's most depressing album lyrically, and musically it is as bright is a sunny may afternoon. I always thought if I heard an album like this it would be genius, much like Lou Reed's Berlin, but I must say Bryter Layter totally put all this to rest. It is just down right annoying and for those people out there who don't listen to the lyrics, (they know all the worlds but not what they mean which blows me away) this would seem like a happy album, which it totally is not.<br /><br />So no I can't truly give this a better rating than a three because it simply isn't that good. With all hype and tragedy aside, Drake was a genius but genius doesn't always work out for the better as attested to here.really bothers me about this record is that it is without a doubt Drake's most depressing album lyrically, and musically it is as bright is a sunny may afternoon.

Unlike some of the earlier books, this one is filled with comments about the weaknesses and the deterioration (according to Mankell) of traditional Swedish society and mores.  He laments the breakdown of the nuclear family while making the point that post-WWII society has done much to raise the standard of living for the average Swede.

However, in my opinion, that doesn\\'t make this album less brilliant than her previous two.  It\\'s a solid release and I think it just takes a couple of thorough listening sessions to let it sink in.<br /><br />For one, the lyrics on this album are by far her most expressive ever.  If you take the time to actually listen to them, they tell a story that you can picture in your head.  That\\'s brilliant song writing. Sure, a lot of it is sad, and it might not be your cup of tea, but she wrote it from the heart without the intention of making perfect \\\\\\\\\"pop\\\\\\\\\" songs.<br /><br />Also, the musicianship and production is the best I\\'ve heard from Dido.  I\\'m surprised at the 1 star reviews due to this aspect alone.  Some of the drumming is amazing, and the use of different types of instruments is a nice change from other typical pop albums.  The arrangements are also very unusual, but fresh.  However, that may be another reason the songs don\\'t sound so \\\\\\\\\"radio friendly\\\\\\\\\" as some prefer.  It is not too busy sounding and cluttered as you sometimes hear in over-produced albums.  You can clearly here ALL parts being played as well as the intricate sounds in the background that Dido sometimes likes to throw in.<br /><br />My only (slight) disappointed might be Dido\\'s use of her own voice.  Her voice is definitely in top form and pleasant as usual.  However, she doesn\\'t sing with the authority she\\'s capable of.  Anyone who has seen her perform live knows she\\'s capable of singing more strongly to give more impact to the songs.  However, since most of the songs on this album are mellow, her soft airy voice works well to convey the emotion.<br /><br />Anyway, please give this album a couple of tries before dismissing it. If you can\\'t get past Dido\\'s typical style and be open to her new sound, then in my opinion, you don\\'t really accept the strength or growth of her as a songwriter.

This is a dark movie about a sad lonely boy who is coming of age, dealing with bullies and suddenly meets a young girl who he befriends.

The father story left me wondering wether alcoholism led to his situation but then again there could even be a creepier element there.

His part was too small for me to notice him in BODY HEAT. The critics had caught a glimpse of him and his potential in that film. I knew that I was on to something watching him as the fast talking womanizing Baltimore con-artist Boogie, in Levinson\\'s DINER. His honesty as an actor pierced my emotions, even though he was playing a character that was lying throughout the entire film. When I witnessed his serene and suicidally introspective portrayal of The Motorcycle Boy in Coppola\\'s urban dreamscape of S.E. Hinton\\'s teenage angst novel RUMBLE FISH, I knew that I had just witnessed The Rebirth of James Dean. When I saw his cool slowburning streetwise Italian dreamer, Charlie in THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLIAGE, I knew I had found a film actor I could idolize. I wore my hair like him. I tried to dress like him. I wanted to be him. Man, this was the COOLEST actor taking the coolest parts in Hollywood! Mickey was IT!<br /><br />But, like Dean, it seemed that Mickey would metaphorically and almost literally crash and leave us with only three truly GREAT films. After a few briefly compelling performances in the 80s as the hardboiled Kowalski in Cimino\\'s YEAR OF THE DRAGON, the lascivious John in 9 1/2 WEEKS, Harry Angel in ANGEL HEART, and the hilarious Henry Chinaski in BARFLY, Mickey\\'s career dwindled into lesser leads, bit parts, and cameo roles. Mickey became \\\\\\\\\"difficult\\\\\\\\\" to work with. Mickey wanted to give up the studio politics and the collaborative involvement with a craft that he was, quite literally, born to do. And become what? A boxer? The owner of a hair salon? A biker? A thug? Then, Mickey lost himself for 14 years. In a reply to a ten year hiatus question backstage at The Golden Globes, Rourke said, \\\\\\\\\"Let\\'s get it right. Ten years sounds easy.\\\\\\\\\" Ultimately, he was alone. Mickey Rourke was forced to do some soul searching.<br /><br />Into the 21st Century, no one noticed Mickey\\'s hilarious turn as The Cook in SPUN. A wild and sardonically dark comedy about methamphetamine users. (The Cook watches and adores wrestling on TV while cooking up his dope. One wonders if this gave Aronofsky the idea to cast Rourke in THE WRESTLER?) His sad and tender moment at the end of that film was a revelation of things to come. The final monologue is a wonderful precursor to his character in THE WRESTLER. It broke my heart. Then, a new generation of fans and critics were talking about him again, after grabbing everyone\\'s attention as disfigured Marv in Robert Rodriguez\\' comic book pastiche, SIN CITY. Sort of a throwback to Rourke\\'s JOHNNY HANDSOME. The best thing about SIN CITY was Rourke\\'s performance. It stood out like a sore thumb. Even over the special look of that film.<br /><br />Now, things have changed for Mr. Rourke. With the critical acclaim (for once they got it right) for this film, he is all over the talk show circuit recalling his loneliness, his mistakes, and episodes from his former life. Like a 12 stepper, Mickey now seems humble and apologetic. Thanking everyone for giving him the chance to once again become the serious actor he once was. (We should all thank them too.) He is no longer taking anything for granted. Everyone loves a humble winner. And God Bless him, Mickey Rourke is BACK! And his performance in THE WRESTLER is a WINNER!<br /><br />The generous Mr. Darren Aronofsky has given Mickey Rourke the role of a lifetime with this film. Knowing Rourke\\'s reputation for being next to impossible to work with, Aronofsky could not get the financing for this film when he first attached Mickey\\'s name to the project, but promised Mickey an Oscar nomination if he would only listen to his direction and do everything he was told to do. Mickey kept his promise, and it appears that the masterly and prescient Aronofsky has kept his. THE WRESTLER was not written for Mickey Rourke, but was later tailored to fit him personally. The themes are semi-autobiographical.<br /><br />The story is not complicated. Although, changed and improvised due to Rourke\\'s involvement, the script, written by Robert Siegel, is reminiscent of a 20\\'s or 30\\'s bloody pulp fiction boxing story that could have been penned by the creator of Conan The Barbarian, the late Robert E. Howard. It is a simple pulp character study about a lonely beaten man who has been to the top of the mountain only to be brought back down again by the repercussions of his actions, and a savage career choice that has taken a brutal toll on his body from staged battles, steroid juice abuse, and a lot of 80\\'s Hair Metal. (The biggest laugh in the film, comes from Rourke\\'s line about Kurt Cobain and what he did to 80\\'s Metal.) Filmed in a grainy Indy style with long loose tracking shots and circular handheld camera movements, it is a sad, gritty, brutal, and COMIC semi-documentary narrative told mostly from Randy \\\\\\\\\"The Ram\\\\\\\\\" Robinson\\'s POV. Not every movie goer will appreciate the raw look of this film, the patchwork sequences, or the triumphantly open ending. True film lovers will.<br /><br />The performances here are very brave indeed. Marisa Tomei is essential as Cassidy. She bares it all as a sweet, conflicted, past her prime stripper mom, unwilling to succumb to The Ram and his half desperate attention for her affections. Most 40 something actresses wished they looked this good, but might never agree to pole dance almost completely nude in a film about an aging wrestler. You will fall in love with her all over again in this film. Her Nomination for a Golden Boy is well deserved.<br /><br />Unlike De Niro who donned 40 lbs of fat for his role as Jake LaMotta, Rourke bulked up approximately 40 lbs of muscle on top of his already commanding girth. Rourke is scarred, pimpled, pumped, and battered. His body and visage are roadmaps of world weariness and pain. One grim shot shows Rourke shooting steroids into his veiny, mottled, and scarred rearend. A selfless dedication and adherence to character. A fearless commitment by a great actor to shamelessly open himself up to his audience. Baring his wounded nakedness, as well as the internal wounds to his lonely psyche. And isn\\'t this what we love about our greatest actors? This film IS Mickey Rourke. Body and Soul. This is an extremely giving performance. It is symbolic, commanding, sad, demanding, honest, demure, comic, tender, uplifting, and most of all, heartbreaking.<br /><br />A broken man searches for acceptance, dignity, and redemption, but finds himself instead.<br /><br />The same can be said about The Second Coming of Mickey Rourke. THIS IS A GREAT FILM! Just give this man his Oscar.

I actually started reading the book that this series was based on by Evan Wright before I started the series. The characters that were described so well in the book are brought to life on screen with a fabulous cast that is led by Alexander Skarsgard as Brad Colbert, Team Leader.  This series cetainly shows his range as an actor.  He\\'s the \\\\\\\\\"iceman\\\\\\\\\" - calm, tough and calculating, but also shows humor, compassion and downright sadness at times.  We get many glimpses of him behind a large gun and what he conveys with his eyes nothing short of amazing.

Here is one of the great myths of modern man and the Age of Science and Reason; it\\'s a myth that in some respects is even more relevant today with the prospect of widespread genetic engineering. The dream of unlocking the secret of life--and the parallel fear that it might turn into a nightmare remains with us long after Shelley gave it form in this short novel.<br /><br />On the downside, Shelley\\'s prose bears all the faults of the age in which it was composed. *Frankenstein* is almost unbearably overwritten, its characters melodramatically overwrought, and the whole production bathed in the over-the-top hysteria that often typifies Romantic literature. It\\'s comical to hear long eloquent orations delivered by characters in the middle of scenes in which they\\'re literally fighting for their lives--and, indeed, even more ridiculous to hear the monster himself speaking like a Shakespearean actor. To be sure, Shelley\\'s monster is a great deal different than the green-skinned blockhead of the movies, no bolts in his neck, jagged forehead scar, or monosyllabic groans here. This is a pensive, autodidactic monster. Still, the way Shelley envisions him, he\\'s actually far more horrific than Boris Karloff or Herman Munster. Here we have a stitched together assemblage of corpse-parts that the flesh doesn\\'t always entirely cover, leaving the workings of tendons and the like grotesquely exposed to view. He\\'s a wild, ragged, hideous-looking zombie, but not a shambling, sleepwalking, unfeeling drone; instead, he\\'s super-strong, super-agile, super-fast--and he\\'s as eloquent as Cicero.<br /><br />Certainly, Shelley felt it necessary to give the monster a brain and the silver-tongue to express its complex cogitations because *Frankenstein* is, in the end, more a philosophical novel than a tale of horror. What does it mean to be human? Do we overstep our bounds by encroaching on the miracles of life and try to play \\\\\\\\\"god\\\\\\\\\"? Is there a god? Do we not feel pity for the \\\\\\\\\"monster,\\\\\\\\\" which, by its appearance alone, seems to be the embodiment of all we loathe and fear...and yet, in fact, only wants for compassion and companionship to make it \\\\\\\\\"human\\\\\\\\\"? These are the kinds of questions that Shelley asks in *Frankenstein* and to do so she allows her monster to defend himself in the court of ideas like F. Lee Bailey.<br /><br />For that matter, it\\'s somewhat hard to wrap one\\'s mind around the fact that Shelley\\'s Victor Frankenstein begins his work at reanimating corpses while still at college and--instead of the more appropriate middle-aged scientist familiar from innumerable remakes--Dr. Frankenstein in this novel is no older than his mid-20s throughout. Apparently, Shelley herself wasn\\'t yet twenty when originally composing the tale, so that perhaps explains Frankenstein\\'s age here, but it doesn\\'t seem quite right to have him be so young.<br /><br />Still, if you can get past the various absurdities, the purple prose, the frequent repetition, and the more tedious travelogue descriptions of the countrysides of Switzerland, Scotland, the frozen north, etc. there are some genuinely frightening scenes and, more importantly, still-compelling ideas that make Shelley\\'s *Frankenstein* not only the original, but the best elucidation of the myth of the mad man of science and the responsibility of the creator towards ((and for)) that which he creates.

All the danger signs were there - a rushed script because of a writers' strike, threats of Bond going rogue again plus the problem that great Bond films are usually followed by naff ones. The short running time wasn't encouraging, nor the bigger budget and promise of more action.     Well, this isn't one of the great Bond films, and Casino Royale set the bar far too high for it to compete. But it's certainly not a disappointment if you go in aware of that, and more gratifyingly, the similarities to Licence To Kill are superficial. Where Casino Royale was like making love all night long, this is more of a gratifyingly frenzied *beep* of a film. The running time isn't a problem because, like From Russia With Love, this is a pared down machine with no fat to trim away, throwing out all the overused touchstones to get down to business. From a plot point of view there's maybe a little too much one corpse leading to the next plot point in the first third, but the film wisely ditches that approach early.     Dan Bradley's action scenes are thankfully not as ineptly over-edited and incoherent as in Paul Greengrass' films, but aren't as impressive as Gary Powell's work on Casino Royale. There are moments of familiarity - a motorbike sequence borrows from the unimpressively shot harbour scene in Jackie Chan's The Protector, but without the lethargic pacing, while an aeriel dogfight owes a lot to a famously rejected stunt originally intended for the opening of GoldenEye - and the opening car chase through heavy traffic could have benefited from not trying quite so hard. But within them there are moments of stylisation that few other Bonds have attempted and failed at but which are far more successful here, most notably an impressive opera sequence that could have done with a few more shots to clarify the odd mechanical detail (something other parts of the film could benefit from). It's also surprisingly vicious - for perhaps the first time in a Bond film, innocent bystanders are deliberately killed. That said, the rationale for the explosions at the end is more than a little dubious.     The film isn't as humorless as some have complained: there's a lot of dry humor where appropriate and a delightfully playful game of cat-and-mouse with Bond and M in a hotel, but none of the outright slapstick comedy that dragged the series down before. Nor is Forster's direction or the editing as awkward as some found it: there's a pleasingly epic scale to the film allied with a non-nonsense straight-down-to-business attitude that works well for this particular story.     The most curious complaint is that it's just action with no character development, when nothing could be further from the truth. While there is more action, the characterisation is integrated into both plot and action. Bond is once again on an emotional journey - forgiveness, believe it or not, is ultimately the quantum of solace of the title - though this time the heart and soul of the film is Giancarlo Giannini's Rene Mathis, the kind of man Bond might be capable of becoming and one he learns something about himself from. One of their scenes is easily one of the very finest moments in the entire history of the series.     Craig still owns the role impressively and Jeffrey Wright starts to come in to his own as Felix Leiter this time round. Mathieu Amalric is one of the better villains of the past twenty years. He won't be among the greats, but he convinces and the scheme is genuinely ingenious in its simplicity. Olga Kurylenko manages to shake off the ineptness of her former performances to be a more than adequate but not especially memorable female lead, though Gemma Arterton lets the side down badly in a part that has unwelcome elements of Serena Gordon in GoldenEye and Rowan Atkinson in Never Say Never Again. Thankfully it's a small role so her weak and stilted straight-out-of-stage-school acting can't do too much damage.     Intriguingly, the film exists in a more convincing world of global politics than we've seen before in a Bond film: SPECTRE would have loved to be around in an era when governments eagerly step into bed with crime syndicates if it suits their ends and where corporations are able to play governments and intelligence agencies against each other. Here Bond works for a British government that tortures suspects on foreign soil and blindly goes along with foreign interests and crime syndicates alike in its desperation to snatch the scraps from the superpowers' tables. Initially, Bond is just as ruthless and morally flawed as his masters, the bullish arrogance gradually being smoothed away by emotional experience as he learns the importance of forgiveness to find the quantum of solace of the title that he needs to go on.     Yes, there are weaknesses - M's office is overdesigned, a few scenes could have played better, the song is crap and the gunbarrel sequence is a big and unnecessary mistake - but it's not the crushing disappointment some are claiming. It may not be a great Bond movie, but it most definitely is a Bond movie, and a damn good night out at the pictures. And one that left me seriously thinking that even if the series never recaptures the high of Casino Royale,we may just be entering a genuine second golden age of Bond movies.     Although a decent but  unspectacular array of extras have been announced for the two-disc DVD, don't be too surprised if there's a double-dip 3-disc set in a year or so's time as with the recent Casino Royale collector's edition.\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'n03z_H0BANdU85SxOcAF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 14208248, 'review_id': 'RP64JKXSEQDQD', 'product_id': '159448385X', 'product_parent': 801147302, 'product_title': 'A Thousand Splendid Suns', 'product_category': 'Books', 'star_rating': 5, 'helpful_votes': 0, 'total_votes': 0, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'A Thousand Splendid Suns', 'review_body': 'Excellent story, interesting, well written.

It\\'s a hit-record by the numbers, but this is really, REALLY well done.<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"Just Dance\\\\\\\\\" is such an obvious monster at radio that I imagine record company execs were literally drooling over the future numbers -- any song THIS well done can move a million units in re-mixes ALONE. \\\\\\\\\"Poker Face\\\\\\\\\" is double-bridged (using a bridge into chorus and another bridge out of it), \\\\\\\\\"Just Dance\\\\\\\\\" uses a rap in the place of a guitar solo (her own, in one mix, a male voice for the current radio edit) -- again, this is all about harmonic contrast. Some of the songwriting here is remarkably sophisticated, the crux of it is that the sophistication here is used to communicate the simplest of possible messages -- another contrast -- call it poetic contrast, if you like.<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"Just Dance\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"Poker Face\\\\\\\\\" are obvious singles, although \\\\\\\\\"Poker Face\\\\\\\\\" is not your typical single selection due to the incredible degree of songwriting sophistication -- the fidelic qualities aside, here. I do wish Gaga would fade-out the obvious singles instead of hard-stopping everything; some at radio seemed to have re-mixed a fade-out into Gaga\\'s titles themselves, and feels correct for mass market airplay -- and Gaga, if you\\'re reading this, let me say that this feels utterly correct for club-play, as well; it\\'s not exactly a secret that giving the DJ a nice long fade-out to work with makes things a lot easier for the guy spinning the wax at any club, and improves your own spin-count.<br /><br />I notice (welllll... at least I think I notice) that Gaga is sharp enough to keep the bass line slightly leading the drums during choruses, while the bass line seemingly trails the drums during verses -- the choruses thereby seem WONDERFULLY set-off and are some TRUE earworms. Gaga has a voice that seems to be in F, is naturally sharp, and with a natural trill as well as power -- Gaga CAN sing, keys are held and pitches are true, even live (well, from what I\\'ve seen at YouTube so far) -- and is set off, once again, by backing vocals that are male, generally in E or C, generally buried in the mix, used to set-off her own vocals via contrast -- Gaga is clearly the star of this show.<br /><br />The amount of thinking that went into the production here is obvious; this is an absolute monster of a record made by people who clearly know what they are doing. Gaga\\'s look, presence, manner, and sound are the result of an awful lot of thought -- she has everything she needs to be the next generation\\'s Cher, and I mean that in a good way.<br /><br />You know... one more thought: we have had so many years of pop music pretending to be anti-pop; think of the entire grunge movement, for example... that Gaga\\'s timing into the marketplace couldn\\'t have been more perfect: Gaga\\'s quote that pop art, \\\\\\\\\"will never be low-brow,\\\\\\\\\" allows her to actually position herself as a musical anti-hero by firmly embracing the confines of pop AS AN ACT OF REBELLION.

They blew open the door for artists who have experimented with icy electronics while recalling the paranoid frenzy of some of rock and roll\\'s greats; here, then, is the missing link between Unknown Pleasures and Silent Shout.

She is happy to spend her days exploring outside and meeting her new neighbors.  On a rainy day with nothing to do Coraline explores her flat, and discovers a door that opens upon a brick wall. Her mother explains that it was closed up when the house was divided. Fascinated by this door Coraline decides to explore it one day when her dad is too busy working and her mom has gone shopping. Only this time when she opens the door it opens on a flat that is the mirror image of her own. Things seem a lot more fun on this side of the door, everyone is nicer to her, her room is prettier, everyone says her name correctly and even the food is tastier. Except for one problem, Coraline's other mother and other father don't seem to want to let her go back home to her real parents. They want to keep her forever and make her their own little girl.  Worst of all they don't have real eyes, just shiny black button eyes.<br /><br />Lots of creepy little things that go bump in the night populate this book. But the best part of the book is Coraline herself. She is brave, even when she is most afraid; and above all she is clever. She is going to need all of that bravery and all of her brains to get herself back home because her real parents have disappeared and Coraline is the only one who can save them.<br /><br />I can see my children really loving this book when they were younger. It's full of lots of creepy rats, spooky mirrors and mysterious basements, trap doors and a mean `witch'. It's also got a lot of humor in it. It reminded me a lot of Roald Dahl's darker children's books and my girls adored them. It might be a bit scary for really young children but most kids and adults will love it.\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'tE3z_H0BANdU85SxOcAF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 23583073, 'review_id': 'RTNCI26R4W4G1', 'product_id': 'B0019FUFM8', 'product_parent': 733353586, 'product_title': 'The Contract', 'product_category': 'Digital_Video_Download', 'star_rating': 1, 'helpful_votes': 0, 'total_votes': 9, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'Amazon Screws Up Again', 'review_body': \"This is the third movie I've rented based on a trailer that has nothing to do with the movie.

The sound is excellent; and the price for this set was fairly competitive.        The most irritating feature of this set is how the symphonies are cut up, butchered, so that most of them are spread over two discs.  Only Nos 1, 4, 5, and 6, are contained on a single disc.  Strange, since even the longer symphonies, such as No 2 (Resurrection) and No 8 (Of a Thousand) have been released individually on a single CD.      Solti does provide us with some superb interpretations, however.  Symphony No 8 stands out, for example, one of the most difficult concert works to pull together successfully.

This is one of those rare movies that can be enjoyed by fans of the original comic book series and those completely oblivious to the various sub-plots of Batman\\'s legacy.  The acting is largely very well done and most of the story elements are very well put together.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />This installment in the series re-introduces Heath Ledger as \\\\\\\\\"The Joker\\\\\\\\\" in a role that will be often discussed and deservedly so.  But the story is more complex than the Joker alone, and plays on the various psychological games that he plays on Gotham\\'s various groups, including the public, the police, organized crime and Batman himself.  In that sense, there is a great deal of depth to the story that makes it easy to suspend disbelief considering not everybody is quick to believe comic-book plot-lines.<br /><br />But there are also several unanswered questions about the story and the fates of some of its characters.  Long time Batman fans will be more aware of some of the minor departures from the original stories, but it\\'s impossible to discuss them without spoiling the plot.  By and large, the areas where the story is altered are well done.  Just be prepared for some nagging questions at the end that are certain to be answered by one or more sequels.<br /><br />THE CAST<br /><br />The casting is top notch.  Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Christian Bale and Gary Oldman turn in great performances in their roles, mostly static carry-overs from \\\\\\\\\"Batman Begins.\\\\\\\\\"  And Aaron Eckhart is wonderful in his role as Harvey Dent, so much so that he could have certainly been nominated for several awards as well. But perhaps the one role that I was not entirely happy with was that of Rachel, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.  While she is certainly a capable actress, I found most of her scenes showed little range or emotion.  I have to wonder if the part was written that way or if she simply underplayed the role.  In any case, these are very small details considering that her role is still serviceable and doesn\\'t detract from the story.<br /><br />THE CAMERA WORK AND SOUND<br /><br />The other element that should be considered with this movie is the extremely dark colors and shadows used throughout the film, perhaps to symbolic effect.  \\\\\\\\\"Batman Begins\\\\\\\\\" was very dark, but this takes that morbid darkness to another level.  The camera work and lighting are excellent.  But the quality of your home screen will greatly influence your ability to appreciate the visuals of this movie.  Be prepared to watch this movie in absolute darkness.  Also be ready for a sound mix that alternates somewhat between low dialogue and the loud sounds of gunfire and explosions.<br /><br />THE SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />The Two-Disc Special Edition includes some extras and a \\\\\\\\\"Digital Copy,\\\\\\\\\" a convenient way to get a DRM accepted version of the film for your mobile devices.  You still have to enter in a special code, which is included, in order to obtain and access the copy.<br /><br />There are also six individual scenes from the IMAX wide-screen, though you have to play them one by one.  Standard galleries are included with production stills and poster art. We also have the \\\\\\\\\"Gotham Tonight\\\\\\\\\" news features with surprise appearances by none other than Anthony Michael Hall.  Those features are actually great to watch with those less familiar with the Batman story before watching the movie.<br /><br />The \\\\\\\\\"Gotham Uncovered\\\\\\\\\" extra includes two parts: \\\\\\\\\"The Evolution of the Knight\\\\\\\\\" covers some of the details on the new suit and Bat-pod, and \\\\\\\\\"The Sound of Anarchy\\\\\\\\\" includes a nice discussion on the score as created by Hans Zimmer, which is very good. The thing that I noticed most about \\\\\\\\\"The Sound of Anarchy\\\\\\\\\" is Hans Zimmer\\'s impressive editing and mixing workstation.<br /><br />But the extras of disk two may still fall short of the impressive extras that were included with the [[ASIN:B0017HPHBM Batman Begins (Limited Edition Gift Set)]].  So while this is still a very good release, many will want to buy the widescreen edition for now and save their money for the next special edition that is likely to come or the Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This film is an achievement.  I only wish that I could have seen it in the IMAX release. This may be a movie worth upgrading to high-definition Blu-Ray for. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Enjoy.good release, many will want to buy the widescreen edition for now and save their money for the next special edition that is likely to come or the Blu-Ray release.

At that time I was still not entirely comfortable with the English language, and I was going through the library picking up easy books to read, which usually tend to be in the fantasy section. The kind of books where a young boy is helped by a wizard and some other mythological creatures to become all he can be... a king or hero of some sort.  So, it was by pure chance that I picked up GRRM's masterpiece. My only regret is that I did not play the lottery that day.  That summer day, I embarked on one of the most rewarding reading experiences of my life.<br /><br />There is not much I can say about this book that hasn't been said already.  Its epic scope is unparalleled; its characterization is far superior to any in fantasy, and in par with the best fiction of any genre; and Martin's style of writing creates the perfect balance between grand storytelling and individual examination. There is such a vivid description of everything from the terrain, the castles and cities, and the people...so so many people; I have to look back at War and Peace to come up with comparative dramatis personae.  The very thought that such an intricate world could really be encompassed by a fantasy writer is audacious. However, Martin did not just whip the Seven Kingdoms out of thin air. In fact, there are many real-life historical correlations to the world where the story is set, starting with the very map (which you can try and figure out with a mirror or a bit of imagination).  But do not be fooled, this is not historical fiction, nor would I say this is fantasy.  What GRRM has done, is create his own genre, fantasy so real that it transcends the genre, and puts swords and sorcery, albeit a large dose of the first and minimal sprinklings of the second, to the forefront of contemporary fiction.<br /><br />Believe the hype, for it really is as good as it sounds.  I purposefully will not give away any plot related information, because I think this book should be read with as little foreknowledge as possible, for that way, with every turn of the page you will be amazed. It is probably best if I provide a personal example.  I have a very long list of books that I intend to read, on top of that I have an exhaustive curriculum in grad school, and yet I found the time to re-read Game of Thrones ten years later, not simply to refresh my memory, but because when a tapestry is as rich as the one that Martin weaves, one can't help but admire its beauty time and time again.ion, because I think this book should be read with as little foreknowledge as possible, for that way, with every turn of the page you will be amazed.

Lionel Shriver doesn't try to *trick* or talk down to the reader. She has created a character (Eva) who is not only brutally honest, but makes no apologies. Eva is not a sympathetic character and I really appreciated that. A book about 'blah blah blah - violence in schools - blah blah blah - why why why?' could so easily have been cliche but Shriver takes a completely different approach to an already overplayed topic. What if your child is truly a bad seed? What if his sociopathic tendencies have been so cleverly executed that your family thinks you are the crazy one and not your son? Eva talks at length, honestly and openly, about how from the minute her son was born she never felt an attachment to him. She never directly questions why her son did what he did. In many ways, she is as emotionally cold and detached as Kevin. Even her relationship with her daughter is without extreme emotion. What makes this book so creepy is that Eva never truly makes the connection just how alike she and her son are. Also, I liked that Kevin did not fall into the stereotype of 'school shooter'. Even better, he didn't use a gun. He's a very interesting character study -- not your typical 'oh poor me, the world is out to get me, i wear trench coats and black coats to stand out and I have access to a gun' character. Shriver has created a sociopath who deserves his own follow up novel.<br />I never thought that Eva's journey was cathartic nor did I think that Shriver was disguising the fact that the letters Eva writes were to her deceased husband. I think Eva wanted to put her journey in writing in hopes of having a better understanding. There is no answer to why kids act the way they do. And Kevin is an entirely different breed of interesting and terrifying kid. Eva has nothing left to lose, so through her letters she can express the utmost honesty. I believe that she did love her husband, but Shriver never makes this relationship overdramtic, in keeping with Eva's nature.ic, in keeping with Eva's nature.\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': '003z_H0BANdU85SxOcAF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 33946943, 'review_id': 'R24MA75KGJ9YIO', 'product_id': '1401219268', 'product_parent': 777411096, 'product_title': 'Watchmen', 'product_category': 'Books', 'star_rating': 5, 'helpful_votes': 0, 'total_votes': 1, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': True, 'review_headline': 'Watchmen Novel - amazing', 'review_body': 'I am very excited for the movie as from the previews it appears to hold VERY true to the original Gibbons graphic novel.

Here\\'s one interesting tidbit.    I have an early pressing of the CD, before \\\\\\\\\"Endless, Nameless\\\\\\\\\" was added at the end as a bonus track.  The credits state: \\\\\\\\\"All song lyrics by Kurt Cobain / Music by Nirvana.\\\\\\\\\"  This was still in the early Geffen days when they decided to split compositional credit equally.    Once it became obvious to Kurt just how big Nirvana was going to be, he forced a contract change which required the majority of all compositional credit to be given exclusively to him, both going forward and retroactively.  The implication is that he felt he did most of the creative work anyway, and he would quit the band if the other members did not agree.  Newer pressings, probably including the one offered new on Amazon, will give full musical credit to Kurt for everything except \\\\\\\\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\\\\\\\\", where he graciously allowed the other guys to retain their share.    Maybe Kurt was the driving force behind these songs.  Maybe Krist and Dave did little more but help arrange the bass and drum parts for the tunes that Kurt wrote.  It\\'s just amazing that such a development would occur after an album has been released, which is when most people would think that these issues have already been decided for perpetuity.  After all, he couldn\\'t gather up all of the old pressings and exchange them.

At that time, Paramount Pictures was looking for a movie that could compete with Warner Brothers' release of the new Batman movie, starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. Paramount was hoping, this latest edition of the Star Trek movies, would do the job. Their plans backfired! Batman was well received and did exetremely well at the Box Office. If Star Trek V had been given more time during production and released at a later date, I believe the movie would have been better received. The weakiness in the movie, was the script and with the sub-par special effects. Star Trek's appeal to its fan base, has always been, its special effects. If Industrial Light & Magic had done the special effects for this installment of Star Trek, the movie would have been better received. The storyline involving the Klingons, could have been better defined. The strengths of the movie, focused on the main characters, especially Kirk, Spock & McCoy. The other strength, was Lawrence Luckinbill's portrayal of Sybok. His portrayal of Spock's full blooded Vulcan brother, was excellent. With Sybok's telepathic powers, Kirk,Spock and McCoy, had to deal with the demons of their past,including Spock's inner conflict regarding his mixed heritage. The end of the movie, should have been on the lines of classic Star Trek. The Enterprise's return to Spacedock complete its refit would have more appropriate than a camp fire scene at Yosemite National Park.

After finding out the legendary Joe Bob Briggs had done a couple films in the series on Monstervision way back when we figured it was a no brainer. Now 70's horror is really hit or miss but luckily this one was pretty creepy.<br /><br />The film is based around 2 brothers Mike and Jody. Mike is the younger pain in the a** brother that follows big bro Jody around all the time. While being the little peep freak he is he spies on Jody as he attends a friends funeral only to see something odd. Once everyone has left he notices some really tall man, known as the Tall Man, taking the 500lb casket and launching it into the back of his hearst with ease. Now Mike and Jody go on a hunt of the mortician tall man and get themselves and their friends into a real mess. See the tall man doesn't play that game and sends his back of zombie elves, no relation to Sid, and a sweet flying orb that drills through skulls after the dynamic duo. The films really is all over the place and backs plenty of odd imagery. There were many times we looked at each other and wondered what the hell is going on? It may have been our current state of mind but we're pretty sure this one is tweaked to the max. Just right for the occasion.<br /><br />Overall the film was a fun watch. There were certainly some scares and moments of sheer confusion which adds up to what we're looking for in a b horror. It also had the Tall Man which promises to freak anybody out. The guy is like 8 ft tall and has all sorts of crazy powers. Someone you do not want to mess with. This is a guy that Santa would see coming and destroy a pair of FTL's only to swing them in a clear garbage bag overhead. We have to say this one is worth checking out.

Romero takes writing duties(based on Stephen King stories) and the directing is left to Romero\\'s DP, Michael Gornick.  It only has 3 stories instead of 5 and seems to be missing that tongue in cheek touch of the first film.<br />But I still love the movie!  The first story is about a cigar store wooden Indian that comes to life for some Charles Bronson-esque revenge when some hoodlums rob the general store and kill the owner, played by George Kennedy(\\\\\\\\\"Be sure...Breath Assure!\\\\\\\\\") and his wife.  The second story comes from King\\'s short story collection, Skeleton Crew.  It\\'s about two couples that drive out to a lake in October to swim out to a wooden raft in the middle of the lake.  Why?  I\\'ve never been quite sure.  You practically get cold watching them.  Once on the raft they are attacked by a round, black water creature that looks like a garbage bag half submerged in the water.  Like The Blob, it\\'s hungry and eats anyone it can grab, or whoever gets too close to it.  The third story has a snooty, rich Lois Chiles hitting a hitchhiker on the highway.  She flees the scene, but the dead dude simply isn\\'t gonna leave her alone, and she engages in a war/chase with the zombie-like hitchhiker.<br />Like the first film, these three stories are supposed to be from a comic book, but they are linked together by animated sequences involving Billy(the boy with the Creepshow comic in the first film) being harassed by bullies and getting his revenge.  Also in the animated sequences is \\\\\\\\\"The Creep\\\\\\\\\", a kind of Cryptkeeper character who introduces the stories.  This animation is the cause of some of the criticism of this movie.  I don\\'t mind it terribly, but it is kinda unnecessary and seems there only to pad out running time.  If you ask me, the three stories are all rather solid.  A lot of folks don\\'t particularly care for the first story, but in the immortal words of Meatloaf, \\\\\\\\\"Two out of three ain\\'t bad\\\\\\\\\".  I actually like that first story very much.  \\\\\\\\\"The Raft\\\\\\\\\" is a great little tale that could have even made it into the first film.  Though it changes King\\'s story a bit, it keeps the spirit of the story for sure(the Blob/garbage bag monster in the story had swirling colors in it\\'s body that had a hypnotic, druglike effect on those who looked at it.  There was some sex and a different ending as well.  But the ending was anticlimactic for a film.  The movie\\'s ending was great.).

(Kinsella\\'s latest novel) a while back when it first came out.  This is the book that introduced me to the genre of chick lit, and I greatly enjoyed it.  Perhaps Lexi Smart wasn\\'t the deepest of characters, but the majority of the book was an unfolding of her discovering what it is she really wants out of life, mixed in with some very original humor to keep the pace going.    Confessions of a Shopaholic is NOTHING like that.  I admit I never finished the novel because after reading a particularly despicable act on the main character\\'s part, I got off the train at Penn station and threw it in the trash.  I have never not finished a book out of sheer disgust ... and interestingly enough, I fell into a deep relaxation afterwards knowing that I would never have to deal with Rebecca Bloomwood\\'s retarded problems ever again.    The whole book reads like one car crash after another.  The main character is obviously mentally unstable and a pathological liar, which I found neither funny nor endearing as the author seemed to have intended.  The typical situation in the book plays out like this:  Rebecca sees store, Rebecca goes in and buys too much, Rebecca berates herself, Rebecca goes into deep played-out delusion about how she\\'ll hit the lottery jackpot, win at the casino, marry rich, etc etc etc ... , Rebecca\\'s bubble bursts by some way too obvious event, Rebecca goes into an internal panic attack of massive proportions, Rebecca conjures up new way to lie to her friends, family, coworkers, and so on, to make herself feel better.  For about a hundred pages in the middle of the book this whole cycle goes from start to end every two paragraphs.  I\\'m not kidding. I lost count of how many mini-meltdowns our \\\\\\\\\"heroine\\\\\\\\\" had.  Not to mention that after the first few chapters there\\'s nothing that comes out of this girl\\'s mouth that isn\\'t a lie.  It was the epitome of exhausting and disturbing at the same time ... I got a little more than 2/3rds in before I realized life is too short.    I suppose the first couple of chapters were mildly amusing ... seeing a glimpse of what someone who\\'s in financial trouble goes through.  But the humor stopped after realizing the main character\\'s a pretty horrible person in general.  I reckon I read in other reviews that the story wraps up with her getting her dreams come true, getting a hot rich boyfriend, all for not reason, blah blah blah, no repercussions, blah blah boring!  I won\\'t even go into how laughably bland and alike every single character in this story is.   I just hope that the movie is only loosely based on the novel because the message doesn\\'t need to be going out to the masses that it is cute and socially acceptable for young women to be idiots about their finances and unbearably selfish with their loved ones.      The author can do much better than this, so go read Remember Me?; an immensely more well-written story with a better plot line to boot than this garbage.', 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'FE3z_H0BANdU85SxOcEF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 52976583, 'review_id': 'R6016TKUJC3QD', 'product_id': 'B0015OKWL2', 'product_parent': 904939428, 'product_title': 'Righteous Kill', 'product_category': 'Video DVD', 'star_rating': 4, 'helpful_votes': 0, 'total_votes': 0, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'Decent', 'review_body': 'No, this is not \\\\\\\\\"Heat Part 2\\\\\\\\\", but it\\'s not bad.

But the main reason to watch the movie though is its huge fantastic battles, lots of wonderful blood and gore, strange alien bugs, a little bit more blood and gore, phenomenal special effects, some more blood and gore, a body count in the thousands if not the millions, and even more blood and gore. Did I mention the blood and gore? Starship Troopers has been compared favorably to \\\\\\\\\"Saving Private Ryan\\\\\\\\\" in its Hack-Factor, that is it\\'s mind-numbing violence. The humans have machine guns, nukes, and plasma cannons. The bugs too have plasma cannons, a flame thrower that shoots out their noses, but mostly they have sharp pincers. While a human must blow multiple parts off a bug to kill it, splattering everything with orange or green guts and goo, the bug will stab humans through the chest, lop off heads, bite off legs and rip bodies in two.

Also, the POV feels slightly off balance, with Nasuada and Saphira's POV chapters placed, seemingly, where they would save the most plotting work, rather than where they would be the most meaningful. Most of the side characters in this book also fall short of the previous books' standard(though not all of them), and the new villains are even worse. Nearly everything feels dry and overworked, contrasting the freshness(if not utter originality) in the previous books. The lack of new places and serious new characters is part of this. Also, the explanation for Murtagh and Thorn's enhanced power really comes up lame; it may work in the next book, but it's melodramatic and anticlimactic for now.   In all Brisingr just doesn't have the level of heart and character of the previous two. The good moments in this book do live up to the previous books - there just aren't enough of them.    Pluses: Even though so much of the book feels stale, Eragon still feels like the same person, as do Saphira(except during her POV passages) and Arya. The parts highlighting these characters are the highlights of the book. Brisingr also has a good string of smaller conflicts going on, especially with Eragon trying to get a new sword and the ever-widening number of promises he makes. Overall its very recognizable as part of the same story, while still managing to bring in a few good new things.

The stories don't really need much praise here (except that I confess to finding Little Pig Robinson a rather dull, waffling book that was written during Potter's later years), but still this boxed set is well worth its price. I know it's a hundred dollars and more expensive than the omnibus edition of the tales, but you can really savour the original format of the books. The stores unfold gracefully and the format is more pleasing to the eye, as it's perhaps more organised than the cumbersome omnibus edition. Of course, the illustrations are so very picture-perfect, and the reproductions make them look more vivid than ever. A minor quibble is about the six extra illustrations in Peter Rabbit, as they have made the story drag a little as compared to the final published version we know now. That said, I enjoy this new set tremendously, as it's well-produced on the whole, with nice paper and a new font that is more pleasing to the eye. And the box is really a nice touch too.

The brass section was in these recordings in very bad condition. In that period Jochum recorded Beethoven with the London Symphony and Brahms with the London Philharmonic.I know many readers will blame me but I really think that it would have been much better to record Bruckner with one of these orchestras. This set has many fans between those who have no basis of comparison and praise this cheap but poor issue as a milestone of the discography.  I have to say that to my ears is unbearable to hear Bruckner, who needs an organ-like brass section, played with such a strained brass sound and with so  many grotesque flops (in a studio recording!)  I like Jochum's fervour too, but his intentions where impossible to realize for evident technical limitations. The sound of the trumpets is very strained since the first bars of every symphony. Take the climax of the first movement of the 8th,where the trumpets sound terribly strained and out of tune. The first movement of the 6th where the trumpets are exposed is disastrous,the final bars of the 8th are full of  enthusiasm but the brass are forced to die. The climax of the adagio of the 7th is reached with effort and the sublime following bars close to the coda ,dedicated do Wagner,are again spoiled by clumsy trumpets. Sadly the list of examples would be overlong, everywhere there are trumpets flaws. With adequate trumpets the 5th could have been a magnificent recording,thanks to Jochum's grand and poetical vision(how beautiful are the introduction to the first movement,the development,and the entire second movement! The strings are dreamy).  According to my opinion, the Staatskapelle Dresden gloriously sounding in almost all the romantic repertoire,with  superb strings, sadly had not a brass section in condition to play Bruckner safely at the time of these recordings.  Jochum is very intense,even more than in his first cycle, but the technical problems of the brass  destroy many of the beautiful moments he tried to create, and his demanding crescendos and stringendos are realized with embarassing efforts. The recorded sound is also quite unattractive.  Between the sets of Bruckner symphonies,let alone the legendary 3-9 Celibidache/Emi,I find excellent the 3 cycles recorded by Asahina,an impressive recent issue is with Paternostro(Antes)- despite a few serious orchestral mistakes(but these are live recordings)it is a successful cycle,in opulent sound,with a wonderful 8th- . Chailly's set is also fine, very well played and recorded.The set of the young Haitink for Philips is after around 50 years still highly raccomandable.  But if you are also interested in separate Bruckner cds,there are many successful recordings with Giulini,Wand,Haitink. It is interesting for me to make a comparison with the magnificent recordings of Sinopoli and the same orchestra of Jochum-Emi 20 years later in a much better form and particularly with  Haitink's  majestic 8th Hass ed.- issued in 2009 by Profil- a 2002 live recording,with splendid Dresden brass, sounding as glorious as the strings! The actual condition of Dresden is superb, incomparable with that of the time of Jochum's recording.  Regarding Jochum, run to buy his marvellous live recordings in Japan(Altus): a fantastic long breathed 7th with the Concertgebow and a dramatic 8th with Bamberg,and don't forget the two live 5ths with the Concertgebow!(Philips and Thara)\", 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'KU3z_H0BANdU85SxOcEF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 21857895, 'review_id': 'R29GSY4B94678U', 'product_id': 'B00129H7VS', 'product_parent': 755132112, 'product_title': 'Band of Brothers [Blu-ray]', 'product_category': 'Video DVD', 'star_rating': 5, 'helpful_votes': 2, 'total_votes': 3, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'Incredible', 'review_body': 'Own on DVD as well- Bluray version is incredible!

Black Cat: Mira wasn\\'t as prominently featured last time so she takes the reins on this one and it\\'s basically her singing almost flatly while co-vocalist Helen Marnie chimes in with a great melody now and then. With bouncy production and a catchy synth line, this isn\\'t as hard rocking as \\\\\\\\\"High Rise\\\\\\\\\" but still works great. 9/10    Ghosts: Similar to \\\\\\\\\"Sugar\\\\\\\\\", this first single is meant to hook you in by having a chorus sung fairly often and the \\\\\\\\\"there\\'s a ghost in me/who wants to say I\\'m sorry/doesn\\'t mean I\\'m sorry\\\\\\\\\" line will easily get stuck in your head.  Though not as repetitive as Sugar...at least until the end chorus anyway, the driving bass line and Helen\\'s vocals make this a keeper. 9/10    I\\'m Not Scared:  One word to describe this track would probably be \\\\\\\\\"energetic\\\\\\\\\".  The drums and instruments create almost an ideal track for barreling down the highway at top speeds and of course Helen\\'s vocals are always awesome. That guitar solo is pretty ace too, though slightly buried in the mix. 8.5/10    Runaway: Another single and like \\\\\\\\\"Ghosts\\\\\\\\\" the line is just simply \\\\\\\\\"my little runaway\\\\\\\\\" however it\\'s used a bit too extensively. While it\\'s ideal for the dance floor where you\\'re not noticing it, the line is repeated a bit too often.  But there is a great beat the percussion adds and despite the gripe, the chorus is catchy indeed. 8/10    Seasons of Illusions:A Mira track and I actually grew to like it after awhile. A strange synth sound kind of dominates the whole thing and Helen adds some lovely background vocals. Only thing about the song is like most Mira songs, the songs don\\'t, shall we say, explode or do something that takes the song from great to flat-out awesome. 7.5/10    Burning Up: Helen\\'s vocals sound strangely echo-y but the track as a whole is like a lot of tracks on the album: very \\\\\\\\\"full\\\\\\\\\" sounding with big percussion but it\\'s such a lively and catchy track that it becomes a highlight. Kind of lurches at the end though. 7/10    Kletva: A Mira track and it\\'s another oddity, one of those tracks where it\\'s hard to latch onto though musically it\\'s nicely varied with so much going on at once, \\\\\\\\\"wall of sound\\\\\\\\\" doesn\\'t quite cut it. Only thing that knocks it is that there\\'s no real vocal melody or really anything to hook into. 6/10    They Gave You a Heart, They Gave You a Name: Very punchy and lively track and the interplay between Mira and Helen works quite well whereas in most songs they either sing solo or just do the occasional background vocal like Black Cat. The \\\\\\\\\"lay down beside me\\\\\\\\\" is a good hook to get stuck in your head. 8/10    Predict the Day: I don\\'t really know what to think of this one. It starts with very loud percussion and a whistling tune almost straight out of a Sergio Leone film. It\\'s a nice change of pace from the hyper energy tracks but it\\'s maybe a bit...too strange for some. At least this one adds a new whistle for you when you\\'re out walking. 6.5/10    The Lovers:  Propulsive is the word here as it\\'s almost relentless and Helen\\'s vocals are quite good though at times she\\'s a bit buried and makes her hard to understand but then again, most of the tracks have that. Only thing about the track is that it\\'s fairly short so it\\'s hard to say whether it ends too early or it\\'s the perfect length. 7/10    Deep Blue: Mira returns with her usual flat singing which of course works very well. I actuallyquite enjoyed the track and while the \\\\\\\\\"deep blue I want to give it all to you, deep blue I know it scares you\\\\\\\\\" hook is repeated a fair bit, the track is pretty sweet but then it hits a whole other stratosphere when Helen\\'s vocals come in. Stellar moment when done live. My complaint? She comes in at the last literal minute. Bah. 9/10    Tomorrow: Helen\\'s vocals have a nice dreamy quality during the chorus which almost makes me think of \\\\\\\\\"Whitelightgenerator\\\\\\\\\" from last record though the track\\'s a bit more energetic and has a nice dream-pop quality to it. Hm, that song was also 2nd-to-last track too and this one is as well. Anyway it\\'s a track well worth a checking out. 8.5/10    Versus: Instead of the quiet subdued \\\\\\\\\"All the Way\\\\\\\\\", we have a near-epic. It\\'s a bit long (few hairs short of 6 minutes) but the sound of it just gives it a very rich and full experience and makes for a big fat finale. Only strange thing is there\\'s a male background singer with her which is a nice idea but I don\\'t like how their voices sound together. The vocalist of Stars for example (Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan) sound perfect together. Helen and Daniel Hunt don\\'t all that well. Still nice closer though. 8/10    Only thing that knocks Velocifero down from Witching Hour is diversity in that tracks on this one are either high energy or just odd and something like a Beauty #2 or a fun ditty like The Last One Standing would\\'ve given this a nice mixture but as it is, this is a great release and well worth the time.', 'review_date': Timestamp('2009-01-24 00:00:00')}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'constantin_amazondataproject_v5', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'Mk3z_H0BANdU85SxOcEF', 'status': 429, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'index [constantin_amazondataproject_v5] blocked by: [TOO_MANY_REQUESTS/12/disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block];'}, 'data': {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 12531012, 'review_id': 'RX57ENQPB422T', 'product_id': '0385720920', 'product_parent': 729613164, 'product_title': 'Choke', 'product_category': 'Books', 'star_rating': 5, 'helpful_votes': 1, 'total_votes': 4, 'vine': False, 'verified_purchase': False, 'review_headline': 'Excellent!', 'review_body': \"Everything was smooth and perfect!

Yet despite all this, the book still feels incredibly relevant in today\\'s times. Actually even more relevant as America wakes up to a crisis of confidence in Wall Street.     Almost all characters in this book are contemptible, save for maybe the Lamb kid (although even his wholesome personae is overblown), the little daughter, and the defense lawyer. Yet none of these people are the stars of the book. The real players: Sherman, Bacon, Kramer, and Fallow are incredibly smarmy in their respective fields. You can\\'t root for any of them. Did you want Sherman to win his case or not? Wolfe clearly had a real disdain for these characters and so too did I. But I kind of liked this. I couldn\\'t root for anyone and it kept me on my literary toes.     The only observation that kept running through my head while reading this book was that Bacon, Kramer, and Fallow all had to metaphorically or actually tear down alpha male Sherman in order to feel better about themselves. To that end, I think this book is just as much about American male egotism as it is about anything else.

His stunners have left no doubt that he can poke into a subculture and emerge with a fresh new look at it. But Slumdog goes one better. It is pitch-perfect in its take, but also perhaps his most accessible endeavor thus far.<br /><br />The narrative couches a crisp homage to Bollywood. Funky A.R.Rehman music. A largely Indian crew. Crisp acting, even from kids, in fact especially from kids. And then the gloriously larger-than-life thematic flourishes: poor folks at the behest of a cruel world, friend pitted against friend, brother against brother--and the most tried and tested one of all-- a rags to riches cavalcade of an underprivileged hero who makes it amid impossible odds. It\\'s hero-giri alright.<br /><br />But where it departs from Bollywood is Simon Beaufoy\\'s screenplay. It\\'s dazzling. Professional Indian reviewers have been overly delicate in their reference to Vikas Swarup\\'s novel that inspired the film, \\\\\\\\\"Q & A\\\\\\\\\". The book was an enjoyable read, but the film merely borrows the central premise and that\\'s basically it. There is a scene towards the end with our two protagonists at a train station where a trick of reverse cutting will tell a discerning viewer just how innovative the thinking behind the screenplay truly is--that is such a sweet, affectionate shot that it moistened my eyes.<br /><br />It\\'s a bummer that such fuss and to-do has been made about how this film projects an unfair image of the country. Guess the confusion arises when established reviewers such as Roger Ebert decide to call it a testament to \\\\\\\\\"the real India\\\\\\\\\". I wouldn\\'t be so pedantic. To me, the film carries no such delusions of grand purpose. It\\'s a gleeful entertainer. A breakneck story of one individual from *one* aspect of an astonishingly multifaceted country. To that extent, it covers its subject with addicting vigor and focus. It\\'s witty, gritty, and--for suitable values thereof--sh*tty.<br /><br />To address some petty cavils:<br /><br />(1) The use of English by the characters. It\\'s a British production, what did you expect. There\\'s a world outside a specific country. We call it \\\\\\\\\"International Cinema\\\\\\\\\". Bet there will be local dubbed versions for those who truly desire it that way (now that the film\\'s multitude of nominations have drawn it far away from a SlumUnderdog status).<br /><br />(2) The disrespectful use of the word \\\\\\\\\"dog\\\\\\\\\" in the title. This smacks of nothing but ignorance of colloquialisms. \\\\\\\\\"Word up, dawg\\\\\\\\\", for instance? People forget that an insult becomes an insult only when we choose to let it become one.<br /><br />(3) Finally, the unfairness of how it depicts India in a manner that might give people the WrongIdea. To these Einsteins may I point out that the baffling kaleidoscope we call India makes it pretty hard to ever get the RightIdea to begin with?<br /><br />What level of dimness would make a viewer go seeking a wholesome view of a country in *one* film? Just because \\\\\\\\\"The Godfather\\\\\\\\\" showed with such pizzazz one specific aspect of the American underworld, should we infer that every American is a gun-slinging gangster? \\\\\\\\\"Crouching Tiger..\\\\\\\\\" may have sketched a mellifluous perspective of China, but I don\\'t recall anyone thinking that our Chinese colleagues fly from tree to tree on their way to work. And so on.<br /><br />It\\'s a movie, not a national treatise. Sure, it depicts poverty. So? Those who have expanded their horizons beyond Spiderman Part 38 will know that countless movies have been made in the last decade alone that depict hard times in *every* country. At any rate, reality is nothing but a collectively accepted notion. I\\'d say Slumdog is as equidistant from reality as, say, Bollywood\\'s gigantic palaces (yeah, we live that way) or the scantily-clad \\\\\\\\\"item girls\\\\\\\\\" gyrating on snow-capped mountains.<br /><br />To people who have yet to see this upbeat thriller: ignore all the Pavlovian drivel.

The story is all from her point of view and perspective of this world. She describes the community and culture in such a believable way that you can imagine being there. She creates stories and strategizes on what it might be like for the others in her community and later uses that skill to help her to compete in the Hunger Games.     Her world is filled with the normal young adult concerns and struggles and then her life is suddenly changed when she becomes a competitor for District Twelve to the Hunger games. The competitors are called Tributes. One boy and one girl tribute from each of the twelve districts is selected to play this yearly game. It's fascinating to see this world that sort of resembles today and how it has changed and morphed into something else. People and their behavior are transcendent regardless of their environment.
